15260,18260,How do you observe something you can't see?,c8re1U9rCo4
18260,21260,This is the basic question of somebody who's interested,c8re1U9rCo4
21260,23260,in finding and studying black holes.,c8re1U9rCo4
23260,25260,Because black holes are objects,c8re1U9rCo4
25260,28260,whose pull of gravity is so intense,c8re1U9rCo4
28260,30260,"that nothing can escape it, not even light,",c8re1U9rCo4
30260,32260,so you can't see it directly.,c8re1U9rCo4
32260,35260,"So, my story today about black holes",c8re1U9rCo4
35260,37260,is about one particular black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
37260,40260,I'm interested in finding whether or not,c8re1U9rCo4
40260,43260,"there is a really massive, what we like to call",c8re1U9rCo4
43260,46260,"supermassive"" black hole at the center of our galaxy.""",c8re1U9rCo4
46260,49260,And the reason this is interesting is that,c8re1U9rCo4
49260,52260,it gives us an opportunity to prove,c8re1U9rCo4
52260,56260,whether or not these exotic objects really exist.,c8re1U9rCo4
56260,58260,"And second, it gives us the opportunity",c8re1U9rCo4
58260,61260,to understand how these supermassive black holes,c8re1U9rCo4
61260,63260,"interact with their environment,",c8re1U9rCo4
63260,66260,and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution,c8re1U9rCo4
66260,69260,of the galaxies which they reside in.,c8re1U9rCo4
69260,71260,"So, to begin with,",c8re1U9rCo4
71260,74260,we need to understand what a black hole is,c8re1U9rCo4
74260,76260,so we can understand the proof of a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
76260,78260,"So, what is a black hole?",c8re1U9rCo4
78260,82260,"Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object,",c8re1U9rCo4
82260,85260,because there are only three characteristics that you can describe:,c8re1U9rCo4
85260,87260,"the mass,",c8re1U9rCo4
87260,89260,"the spin, and the charge.",c8re1U9rCo4
89260,91260,And I'm going to only talk about the mass.,c8re1U9rCo4
91260,94260,"So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.",c8re1U9rCo4
94260,96260,"But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object",c8re1U9rCo4
96260,99260,"that we need relatively exotic physics to describe,",c8re1U9rCo4
99260,103260,and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding,c8re1U9rCo4
103260,105260,of the universe.,c8re1U9rCo4
105260,107260,"But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
107260,109260,"for the proof of a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
109260,111260,is to think of it as an object,c8re1U9rCo4
111260,114260,whose mass is confined to zero volume.,c8re1U9rCo4
114260,116260,"So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about",c8re1U9rCo4
116260,119260,"an object that's supermassive,",c8re1U9rCo4
119260,121260,"and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment,",c8re1U9rCo4
121260,124260,it has no finite size.,c8re1U9rCo4
124260,126260,"So, this is a little tricky.",c8re1U9rCo4
126260,130260,"But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see,",c8re1U9rCo4
130260,133260,and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
133260,135260,And that's named after the guy who recognized,c8re1U9rCo4
135260,137260,why it was such an important radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
137260,140260,"This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.",c8re1U9rCo4
140260,142260,So why is it so important?,c8re1U9rCo4
142260,144260,It's important because it tells us,c8re1U9rCo4
144260,148260,that any object can become a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
148260,151260,"That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,",c8re1U9rCo4
151260,153260,the auditorium can become a black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
153260,156260,if you can figure out how to compress it down,c8re1U9rCo4
156260,158260,to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
158260,161260,"At that point, what's going to happen?",c8re1U9rCo4
161260,163260,At that point gravity wins.,c8re1U9rCo4
163260,165260,Gravity wins over all other known forces.,c8re1U9rCo4
165260,168260,And the object is forced to continue to collapse,c8re1U9rCo4
168260,170260,to an infinitely small object.,c8re1U9rCo4
170260,172260,And then it's a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
172260,177260,"So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,",c8re1U9rCo4
177260,179260,"it would become a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
179260,183260,because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
183260,186260,"Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.",c8re1U9rCo4
186260,190260,And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.,c8re1U9rCo4
190260,192260,It depends only on the mass of the object.,c8re1U9rCo4
192260,194260,Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.,c8re1U9rCo4
194260,197260,Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.,c8re1U9rCo4
197260,199260,"So, if I were to take the sun",c8re1U9rCo4
199260,202260,"and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,",c8re1U9rCo4
202260,205260,it would become a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
205260,208260,"So, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.",c8re1U9rCo4
208260,210260,"And it's actually quite a useful concept,",c8re1U9rCo4
210260,212260,because it tells us not only,c8re1U9rCo4
212260,214260,"when a black hole will form,",c8re1U9rCo4
214260,217260,but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
217260,219260,I only need two things.,c8re1U9rCo4
219260,221260,I need to understand the mass of the object,c8re1U9rCo4
221260,223260,"I'm claiming is a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
223260,225260,and what its Schwarzschild radius is.,c8re1U9rCo4
225260,227260,"And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,",c8re1U9rCo4
227260,229260,there is actually only one thing I really need to know.,c8re1U9rCo4
229260,231260,"So, my job in convincing you",c8re1U9rCo4
231260,233260,that there is a black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
233260,235260,is to show that there is some object,c8re1U9rCo4
235260,238260,that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
238260,241260,And your job today is to be skeptical.,c8re1U9rCo4
241260,245260,"Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;",c8re1U9rCo4
245260,248260,I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.,c8re1U9rCo4
248260,250260,"So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,",c8re1U9rCo4
250260,253260,as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
253260,256260,An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state,c8re1U9rCo4
256260,258260,of a really massive star's life.,c8re1U9rCo4
258260,260260,"So, if a star starts its life off",c8re1U9rCo4
260260,262260,"with much more mass than the mass of the Sun,",c8re1U9rCo4
262260,265260,it's going to end its life by exploding,c8re1U9rCo4
265260,268260,and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.,c8re1U9rCo4
268260,270260,And inside that supernova remnant,c8re1U9rCo4
270260,272260,is going to be a little black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
272260,275260,that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.,c8re1U9rCo4
275260,277260,On an astronomical scale,c8re1U9rCo4
277260,279260,that's a very small black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
279260,282260,"Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.",c8re1U9rCo4
282260,286260,And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.,c8re1U9rCo4
286260,289260,And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope,c8re1U9rCo4
289260,292260,shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.,c8re1U9rCo4
292260,294260,There are big ones. There are little ones.,c8re1U9rCo4
294260,297260,Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
297260,300260,And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.,c8re1U9rCo4
300260,304260,"And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
304260,306260,just to give you a sense of scale.,c8re1U9rCo4
306260,308260,"And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
308260,310260,"which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,",c8re1U9rCo4
310260,312260,comes from the light from the stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
312260,314260,"So, we see the galaxy because of the star light.",c8re1U9rCo4
314260,318260,"Now, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.",c8re1U9rCo4
318260,321260,"I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,",c8re1U9rCo4
321260,323260,because they are kind of show offs.,c8re1U9rCo4
323260,325260,And we call them active galactic nuclei.,c8re1U9rCo4
325260,327260,"And we call them that because their nucleus,",c8re1U9rCo4
327260,330260,"or their center, are very active.",c8re1U9rCo4
330260,332260,"So, at the center there, that's actually where",c8re1U9rCo4
332260,334260,most of the starlight comes out from.,c8re1U9rCo4
334260,336260,"And yet, what we actually see is light",c8re1U9rCo4
336260,339260,that can't be explained by the starlight.,c8re1U9rCo4
339260,341260,It's way more energetic.,c8re1U9rCo4
341260,343260,"In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.",c8re1U9rCo4
343260,346260,There are also jets emanating out from the center.,c8re1U9rCo4
346260,350260,"Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain",c8re1U9rCo4
350260,352260,if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
352260,354260,"So, what people have thought is that perhaps",c8re1U9rCo4
354260,357260,there are supermassive black holes,c8re1U9rCo4
357260,360260,which matter is falling on to.,c8re1U9rCo4
360260,362260,"So, you can't see the black hole itself,",c8re1U9rCo4
362260,365260,but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
365260,367260,into the light we see.,c8re1U9rCo4
367260,369260,"So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes",c8re1U9rCo4
369260,371260,exist at the center of galaxies.,c8re1U9rCo4
371260,373260,But it's a kind of indirect argument.,c8re1U9rCo4
373260,375260,"Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion",c8re1U9rCo4
375260,378260,that maybe it's not just these prima donnas,c8re1U9rCo4
378260,380260,"that have these supermassive black holes,",c8re1U9rCo4
380260,383260,but rather all galaxies might harbor these,c8re1U9rCo4
383260,385260,supermassive black holes at their centers.,c8re1U9rCo4
385260,388260,And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy;,c8re1U9rCo4
388260,390260,what we see is the star light.,c8re1U9rCo4
390260,392260,"And if there is a supermassive black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
392260,395260,what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.,c8re1U9rCo4
395260,398260,Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see,c8re1U9rCo4
398260,401260,in active galactic nuclei.,c8re1U9rCo4
401260,404260,If we're going to look for these stealth black holes,c8re1U9rCo4
404260,406260,"at the center of galaxies,",c8re1U9rCo4
406260,410260,"the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.",c8re1U9rCo4
410260,412260,And this is a wide field picture,c8re1U9rCo4
412260,415260,taken of the center of the Milky Way.,c8re1U9rCo4
415260,418260,And what we see is a line of stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
418260,420260,And that is because we live in a galaxy which has,c8re1U9rCo4
420260,422260,"a flattened, disk-like structure.",c8re1U9rCo4
422260,424260,"And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,",c8re1U9rCo4
424260,426260,"we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
426260,430260,or line that defines the plane of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
430260,433260,"Now, the advantage of studying our own galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
433260,436260,is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy,c8re1U9rCo4
436260,438260,"that we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
438260,441260,is 100 times further away.,c8re1U9rCo4
441260,443260,"So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
443260,445260,than anyplace else.,c8re1U9rCo4
445260,447260,"And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail",c8re1U9rCo4
447260,450260,is key to this experiment.,c8re1U9rCo4
450260,453260,"So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass",c8re1U9rCo4
453260,455260,inside a small volume?,c8re1U9rCo4
455260,458260,Which is the job that I have to show you today.,c8re1U9rCo4
458260,460260,And the tool that we use is to watch the way,c8re1U9rCo4
460260,463260,stars orbit the black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
463260,465260,Stars will orbit the black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
465260,468260,in the very same way that planets orbit the sun.,c8re1U9rCo4
468260,470260,It's the gravitational pull,c8re1U9rCo4
470260,472260,that makes these things orbit.,c8re1U9rCo4
472260,475260,"If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,",c8re1U9rCo4
475260,477260,or at least go at a much slower rate,c8re1U9rCo4
477260,480260,because all that determines how they go around,c8re1U9rCo4
480260,482260,is how much mass is inside its orbit.,c8re1U9rCo4
482260,484260,"So, this is great, because remember my job is to show",c8re1U9rCo4
484260,486260,there is a lot of mass inside a small volume.,c8re1U9rCo4
486260,489260,"So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.",c8re1U9rCo4
489260,492260,And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
492260,494260,"So, I want to see the stars",c8re1U9rCo4
494260,496260,that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.,c8re1U9rCo4
496260,500260,Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.,c8re1U9rCo4
500260,503260,"So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.",c8re1U9rCo4
503260,505260,And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used,c8re1U9rCo4
505260,507260,the world's largest telescope.,c8re1U9rCo4
507260,510260,This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes,c8re1U9rCo4
510260,512260,"with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly",c8re1U9rCo4
512260,514260,the diameter of a tennis court.,c8re1U9rCo4
514260,516260,"Now, this is wonderful,",c8re1U9rCo4
516260,518260,because the campaign promise,c8re1U9rCo4
518260,521260,"of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,",c8re1U9rCo4
521260,525260,the smaller the detail that we can see.,c8re1U9rCo4
525260,528260,"But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground",c8re1U9rCo4
528260,532260,has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.,c8re1U9rCo4
532260,534260,And that is because of the atmosphere.,c8re1U9rCo4
534260,536260,Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us,c8re1U9rCo4
536260,538260,to survive here on Earth.,c8re1U9rCo4
538260,541260,But it's relatively challenging for astronomers,c8re1U9rCo4
541260,545260,who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.,c8re1U9rCo4
545260,547260,"So, to give you a sense of what this is like,",c8re1U9rCo4
547260,549260,it's actually like looking at a pebble,c8re1U9rCo4
549260,551260,at the bottom of a stream.,c8re1U9rCo4
551260,553260,"Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,",c8re1U9rCo4
553260,556260,"the stream is continuously moving and turbulent,",c8re1U9rCo4
556260,560260,and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.,c8re1U9rCo4
560260,562260,"Very much in the same way, it's very difficult",c8re1U9rCo4
562260,564260,"to see astronomical sources, because of the",c8re1U9rCo4
564260,566260,atmosphere that's continuously moving by.,c8re1U9rCo4
566260,569260,"So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways",c8re1U9rCo4
569260,572260,"to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.",c8re1U9rCo4
572260,575260,And that buys us about a factor of 20.,c8re1U9rCo4
575260,577260,And I think all of you can agree that if you can,c8re1U9rCo4
577260,580260,"figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,",c8re1U9rCo4
580260,582260,"you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,",c8re1U9rCo4
582260,587260,"say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.",c8re1U9rCo4
587260,589260,And this animation here shows you one example of,c8re1U9rCo4
589260,592260,"the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.",c8re1U9rCo4
592260,594260,You're seeing an animation that goes between,c8re1U9rCo4
594260,597260,an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique --,c8re1U9rCo4
597260,600260,"in other words, just a picture that shows the stars --",c8re1U9rCo4
600260,602260,"and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
602260,604260,where we think the black hole is.,c8re1U9rCo4
604260,607260,"So, without this technology you can't see the stars.",c8re1U9rCo4
607260,609260,With this technology all of a sudden you can see it.,c8re1U9rCo4
609260,611260,This technology works by introducing a mirror,c8re1U9rCo4
611260,613260,into the telescope optics system,c8re1U9rCo4
613260,618260,that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.,c8re1U9rCo4
618260,622260,"So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.",c8re1U9rCo4
622260,624260,"Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on",c8re1U9rCo4
624260,626260,that little square there.,c8re1U9rCo4
626260,628260,"So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,",c8re1U9rCo4
628260,630260,although we've looked at all of them.,c8re1U9rCo4
630260,632260,"So, I want to see how these things have moved.",c8re1U9rCo4
632260,634260,"And over the course of this experiment, these stars",c8re1U9rCo4
634260,636260,have moved a tremendous amount.,c8re1U9rCo4
636260,638260,"So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,",c8re1U9rCo4
638260,640260,and we see the stars go all the way around.,c8re1U9rCo4
640260,643260,"Now, most astronomers have a favorite star,",c8re1U9rCo4
643260,647260,"and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.",c8re1U9rCo4
647260,649260,Absolutely my favorite star in the world.,c8re1U9rCo4
649260,652260,And that's because it goes around in only 15 years.,c8re1U9rCo4
652260,654260,"And to give you a sense of how short that is,",c8re1U9rCo4
654260,659260,the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
659260,662260,"Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
662260,664260,"as possible, take 500 years.",c8re1U9rCo4
664260,668260,"And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.",c8re1U9rCo4
668260,670260,"That's kind of profound, in a way.",c8re1U9rCo4
670260,672260,But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me,c8re1U9rCo4
672260,676260,how much mass is inside a very small radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
676260,679260,"So, next we see a picture here that shows you",c8re1U9rCo4
679260,681260,before this experiment the size to which we could,c8re1U9rCo4
681260,684260,confine the mass of the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
684260,686260,What we knew before is that there was four million,c8re1U9rCo4
686260,689260,times the mass of the sun inside that circle.,c8re1U9rCo4
689260,691260,"And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.",c8re1U9rCo4
691260,693260,You can see a lot of stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
693260,695260,"So, there was actually lots of alternatives",c8re1U9rCo4
695260,698260,"to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
698260,700260,because you could put a lot of stuff in there.,c8re1U9rCo4
700260,702260,"But with this experiment, we've confined",c8re1U9rCo4
702260,705260,that same mass to a much smaller volume,c8re1U9rCo4
705260,709260,"that's 10,000 times smaller.",c8re1U9rCo4
709260,711260,"And because of that, we've been able to show",c8re1U9rCo4
711260,713260,that there is a supermassive black hole there.,c8re1U9rCo4
713260,715260,"To give you a sense of how small that size is,",c8re1U9rCo4
715260,717260,that's the size of our solar system.,c8re1U9rCo4
717260,721260,"So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun",c8re1U9rCo4
721260,723260,into that small volume.,c8re1U9rCo4
723260,726260,"Now, truth in advertising. Right?",c8re1U9rCo4
726260,729260,I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
729260,731260,"And the truth is, I'm not quite there.",c8re1U9rCo4
731260,733260,But we actually have no alternative today,c8re1U9rCo4
733260,736260,to explaining this concentration of mass.,c8re1U9rCo4
736260,739260,"And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date",c8re1U9rCo4
739260,741260,for not only existence of a supermassive black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
741260,744260,"at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.",c8re1U9rCo4
744260,747260,"So, what next? I actually think",c8re1U9rCo4
747260,749260,"this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,",c8re1U9rCo4
749260,751260,so let's move on with the problem.,c8re1U9rCo4
751260,753260,"So, what I want to tell you, very briefly,",c8re1U9rCo4
753260,755260,is a few examples,c8re1U9rCo4
755260,757260,of the excitement of what we can do today,c8re1U9rCo4
757260,759260,"at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,",c8re1U9rCo4
759260,761260,"or at least we believe,",c8re1U9rCo4
761260,763260,that there is a supermassive black hole there.,c8re1U9rCo4
763260,765260,And the fun phase of this experiment,c8re1U9rCo4
765260,768260,"is, while we've tested some of our ideas",c8re1U9rCo4
768260,770260,about the consequences of a supermassive black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
770260,772260,"being at the center of our galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
772260,774260,almost every single one,c8re1U9rCo4
774260,776260,has been inconsistent with what we actually see.,c8re1U9rCo4
776260,778260,And that's the fun.,c8re1U9rCo4
778260,780260,"So, let me give you the two examples.",c8re1U9rCo4
780260,782260,"You can ask, What do you expect""",c8re1U9rCo4
782260,784260,"for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
784260,788260,"for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.""
305;788260;790260;What you expect there is that old stars""",c8re1U9rCo4
790260,792260,should be very clustered around the black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
792260,796260,You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
796260,800260,"Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,",c8re1U9rCo4
800260,802260,they just should not be there.,c8re1U9rCo4
802260,806260,A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.,c8re1U9rCo4
806260,810260,"To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.",c8re1U9rCo4
810260,812260,And it's a very fragile entity.,c8re1U9rCo4
812260,814260,And what does the big black hole do?,c8re1U9rCo4
814260,816260,It strips that gas cloud apart.,c8re1U9rCo4
816260,818260,It pulls much stronger on one side than the other,c8re1U9rCo4
818260,820260,and the cloud is stripped apart.,c8re1U9rCo4
820260,823260,"In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.",c8re1U9rCo4
823260,825260,"So, you shouldn't see young stars.",c8re1U9rCo4
825260,827260,"So, what do we see?",c8re1U9rCo4
827260,829260,"Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,",c8re1U9rCo4
829260,832260,we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.,c8re1U9rCo4
832260,834260,The old ones are red.,c8re1U9rCo4
834260,837260,"The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.",c8re1U9rCo4
837260,839260,"So, you can already see the surprise.",c8re1U9rCo4
839260,841260,There is a dearth of old stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
841260,845260,"There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.",c8re1U9rCo4
845260,847260,"So, this is the fun part.",c8re1U9rCo4
847260,849260,"And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,",c8re1U9rCo4
849260,851260,this mystery of how do you get --,c8re1U9rCo4
851260,853260,how do you resolve this contradiction.,c8re1U9rCo4
853260,855260,"So, in fact, my graduate students",c8re1U9rCo4
855260,859260,"are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,",c8re1U9rCo4
859260,862260,"in Hawaii, making observations to get us",c8re1U9rCo4
862260,864260,"hopefully to the next stage,",c8re1U9rCo4
864260,866260,where we can address this question,c8re1U9rCo4
866260,868260,"of why are there so many young stars,",c8re1U9rCo4
868260,870260,and so few old stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
870260,872260,To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits,c8re1U9rCo4
872260,874260,of stars that are much further away.,c8re1U9rCo4
874260,876260,To do that we'll probably need much more,c8re1U9rCo4
876260,878260,sophisticated technology than we have today.,c8re1U9rCo4
878260,880260,"Because, in truth, while I said we're correcting",c8re1U9rCo4
880260,882260,"for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only",c8re1U9rCo4
882260,884260,correct for half the errors that are introduced.,c8re1U9rCo4
884260,887260,"We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,",c8re1U9rCo4
887260,890260,and what we think we can do is if we,c8re1U9rCo4
890260,892260,shine a few more that we can correct the rest.,c8re1U9rCo4
892260,894260,So this is what we hope to do in the next few years.,c8re1U9rCo4
894260,896260,"And on a much longer time scale,",c8re1U9rCo4
896260,899260,"what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,",c8re1U9rCo4
899260,902260,"because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.",c8re1U9rCo4
902260,904260,"So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.",c8re1U9rCo4
904260,906260,And with this telescope we should be able to see,c8re1U9rCo4
906260,909260,stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
909260,911260,And we hope to be able to test some of,c8re1U9rCo4
911260,914260,"Einstein's theories of general relativity,",c8re1U9rCo4
914260,917260,some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.,c8re1U9rCo4
917260,919260,"So, we think the future of this experiment",c8re1U9rCo4
919260,922260,is quite exciting.,c8re1U9rCo4
922260,924260,"So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation",c8re1U9rCo4
924260,926260,that basically shows you how these,c8re1U9rCo4
926260,929260,"orbits have been moving, in three dimensions.",c8re1U9rCo4
929260,931260,"And I hope, if nothing else,",c8re1U9rCo4
931260,933260,"I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact",c8re1U9rCo4
933260,936260,have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
936260,939260,"And this means that these things do exist in our universe,",c8re1U9rCo4
939260,941260,"and we have to contend with this, we have to explain",c8re1U9rCo4
941260,944260,how you can get these objects in our physical world.,c8re1U9rCo4
944260,947260,"Second, we've been able to look at that interaction",c8re1U9rCo4
947260,950260,"of how supermassive black holes interact,",c8re1U9rCo4
950260,954260,"and understand, maybe, the role in which they play",c8re1U9rCo4
954260,957260,"in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.",c8re1U9rCo4
957260,959260,"And last but not least,",c8re1U9rCo4
959260,961260,none of this would have happened,c8re1U9rCo4
961260,964260,without the advent of the tremendous progress,c8re1U9rCo4
964260,966260,that's been made on the technology front.,c8re1U9rCo4
966260,970260,"And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,",c8re1U9rCo4
970260,973260,and holds a lot in store for the future.,c8re1U9rCo4
973260,975260,Thanks very much.,c8re1U9rCo4
975260,980260,(Applause),c8re1U9rCo4
12515,16118,The universe is teeming with planets.,XYNUpQrZISc
16118,17994,"I want us, in the next decade,",XYNUpQrZISc
17994,20387,to build a space telescope that'll be able to image,XYNUpQrZISc
20387,22488,an Earth about another star,XYNUpQrZISc
22488,25232,and figure out whether it can harbor life.,XYNUpQrZISc

Jet Propulsion Laboratory",XYNUpQrZISc
27392,30253,at Princeton and I are working on technology,XYNUpQrZISc
30253,33791,that will be able to do just that in the coming years.,XYNUpQrZISc
33791,35776,Astronomers now believe that every star,XYNUpQrZISc
35776,37716,"in the galaxy has a planet,",XYNUpQrZISc
37716,39992,and they speculate that up to one fifth of them,XYNUpQrZISc

57760,60082,from six billion kilometers away.,XYNUpQrZISc
60082,61650,I want to take that,XYNUpQrZISc
61650,64232,of an Earth-like planet about another star.,XYNUpQrZISc
64232,66632,Why haven't we done that? Why is that hard?,XYNUpQrZISc
66632,68054,"Well to see, let's imagine we take",XYNUpQrZISc
68054,70000,the Hubble Space Telescope,XYNUpQrZISc
70000,71698,and we turn it around and we move it out,XYNUpQrZISc

123823,126143,The light from the star is diffracting.,XYNUpQrZISc
126143,127884,"It's scattering inside the telescope,",XYNUpQrZISc

129388,131140,that washes out the planet.,XYNUpQrZISc
131140,132411,"So to see the planet,",XYNUpQrZISc
132411,134671,we have to do something about all of that light.,XYNUpQrZISc

148482,151642,"the father of the space telescope, in 1962,",XYNUpQrZISc
151642,153758,and he took his inspiration from an eclipse.,XYNUpQrZISc

155941,157981,The moon has moved in front of the sun.,XYNUpQrZISc
157981,159741,It blocks out most of the light,XYNUpQrZISc
159741,162117,so we can see that dim corona around it.,XYNUpQrZISc
162117,163780,It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up,XYNUpQrZISc
163780,166365,"and blocked that spotlight
that's getting right in my eye,",XYNUpQrZISc
166365,168277,I can see you in the back row.,XYNUpQrZISc
168277,169579,"Well, what's going on?",XYNUpQrZISc
169579,171524,Well the moon,XYNUpQrZISc
171524,173939,is casting a shadow down on the Earth.,XYNUpQrZISc
173939,177174,"We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow,",XYNUpQrZISc
177174,178685,"we look back at the sun,",XYNUpQrZISc
178685,180325,and most of the light's been removed,XYNUpQrZISc
180325,182415,"and we can see that dim, fine structure",XYNUpQrZISc
182415,183690,in the corona.,XYNUpQrZISc
183690,186357,Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.,XYNUpQrZISc
186357,189134,"We build a big screen, we fly it in space,",XYNUpQrZISc
189134,191181,"we put it up in front of the star,",XYNUpQrZISc
191181,192965,"we block out most of the light,",XYNUpQrZISc
192965,195981,"we fly a space telescope in
that shadow that's created,",XYNUpQrZISc
195981,197758,"and boom, we get to see planets.",XYNUpQrZISc
197758,200421,Well that would look something like this.,XYNUpQrZISc
200421,202010,"So there's that big screen,",XYNUpQrZISc
202010,202885,"and there's no planets,",XYNUpQrZISc
202885,205389,"because unfortunately it doesn't
actually work very well,",XYNUpQrZISc
205389,208309,because the light waves of the light and waves,XYNUpQrZISc
208309,209989,diffracts around that screen,XYNUpQrZISc
209989,211773,the same way it did in the telescope.,XYNUpQrZISc
211773,214910,"It's like water bending around a rock in a stream,",XYNUpQrZISc
214910,216700,and all that light just destroys the shadow.,XYNUpQrZISc
216700,219373,It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets.,XYNUpQrZISc
219373,221140,But Spitzer actually knew the answer.,XYNUpQrZISc
221140,223645,"If we can feather the edges, soften those edges",XYNUpQrZISc
223645,225411,"so we can control diffraction,",XYNUpQrZISc
225411,227126,"well then we can see a planet,",XYNUpQrZISc
227126,228925,and in the last 10 years or so we've come up,XYNUpQrZISc
228925,230969,with optimal solutions for doing that.,XYNUpQrZISc
230969,234501,It looks something like that.,XYNUpQrZISc
234501,236846,We call that our flower petal starshade.,XYNUpQrZISc
236846,239806,"If we make the edges of those petals exactly right,",XYNUpQrZISc
239806,241230,"if we control their shape,",XYNUpQrZISc
241230,242788,"we can control diffraction,",XYNUpQrZISc
242788,244234,and now we have a great shadow.,XYNUpQrZISc
244234,246878,"It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before,",XYNUpQrZISc
246878,250324,and we can see the planets beam out just like that.,XYNUpQrZISc
250324,252182,"That, of course, has to be bigger than my thumb.",XYNUpQrZISc
252182,253640,That starshade is about,XYNUpQrZISc
253640,255216,the size of half a football field,XYNUpQrZISc
255216,258806,"and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers
away from the telescope",XYNUpQrZISc
258806,260866,"that has to be held right in its shadow,",XYNUpQrZISc
260866,262830,and then we can see those planets.,XYNUpQrZISc
262830,264238,"This sounds formidable,",XYNUpQrZISc
264238,267246,"but brilliant engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL,",XYNUpQrZISc
267246,270126,came up with a fabulous design for how to do that,XYNUpQrZISc
270126,271200,and it looks like this.,XYNUpQrZISc
271200,272988,It starts wrapped around a hub.,XYNUpQrZISc
272988,274967,It separates from the telescope.,XYNUpQrZISc
274967,277238,"The petals unfurl, they open up,",XYNUpQrZISc
277238,278998,the telescope turns around.,XYNUpQrZISc
278998,281142,Then you'll see it flip and fly out,XYNUpQrZISc
281142,284357,"that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope.",XYNUpQrZISc
284357,286827,It's going to move in front of the star,XYNUpQrZISc
286827,290110,"just like that, creates a wonderful shadow.",XYNUpQrZISc
290110,293914,"Boom, we get planets orbiting about it.",XYNUpQrZISc
293914,295638,(Applause),XYNUpQrZISc
295638,297997,Thank you.,XYNUpQrZISc
297997,299950,That's not science fiction.,XYNUpQrZISc
299950,302513,"We've been working on this
for the last five or six years.",XYNUpQrZISc

305116,307555,out in California at Northrop Grumman.,XYNUpQrZISc
307555,309138,So those are four petals.,XYNUpQrZISc
309138,310850,This is a sub-scale star shade.,XYNUpQrZISc
310850,313347,It's about half the size of the one you just saw.,XYNUpQrZISc
313347,314807,You'll see the petals unfurl.,XYNUpQrZISc
314807,316874,Those four petals were built by four undergraduates,XYNUpQrZISc
316874,319289,doing a summer internship at JPL.,XYNUpQrZISc
319289,320535,Now you're seeing it deploy.,XYNUpQrZISc
320535,322517,Those petals have to rotate into place.,XYNUpQrZISc
322517,323687,The base of those petals,XYNUpQrZISc
323687,326060,has to go to the same place every time,XYNUpQrZISc
326060,327683,to within a tenth of a millimeter.,XYNUpQrZISc
327683,329443,"We ran this test 16 times,",XYNUpQrZISc
329443,332282,and 16 times it went into the exact same place,XYNUpQrZISc
332282,333723,to a tenth of a millimeter.,XYNUpQrZISc
333723,335655,"This has to be done very precisely,",XYNUpQrZISc
335655,338163,"but if we can do this, if we can build this technology,",XYNUpQrZISc
338163,339647,"if we can get it into space,",XYNUpQrZISc
339647,341448,you might see something like this.,XYNUpQrZISc
341448,343720,That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars,XYNUpQrZISc
343720,346314,taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.,XYNUpQrZISc
346314,348698,"If we can take a similar space telescope,",XYNUpQrZISc

354954,357890,"that's a family portrait of our
solar system -- but not ours.",XYNUpQrZISc
357890,360412,We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system,XYNUpQrZISc
360412,362044,"as seen through an occulter,",XYNUpQrZISc
362044,363114,through a starshade like that.,XYNUpQrZISc

367762,369102,next to the residual light,XYNUpQrZISc
369102,371007,is that pale blue dot. That's Earth.,XYNUpQrZISc

373381,374786,"oxygen, ozone,",XYNUpQrZISc
374786,377309,the things that might tell us that it could harbor life.,XYNUpQrZISc
377309,379718,I think this is the coolest possible science.,XYNUpQrZISc
379718,381371,"That's why I got into doing this,",XYNUpQrZISc
381371,383341,because I think that will change the world.,XYNUpQrZISc

19036,20485,A beard full of bees.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
20485,23728,"Now, this is what many of you might picture",R2kOgSVF2Uk
23728,26701,"when you think about honeybees, maybe insects,",R2kOgSVF2Uk

29789,32447,"And let me start by telling you, I gotcha.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
32447,36928,"I understand that. But, there are many things to know,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
36928,39608,"and I want you to open your minds here,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
39608,43098,"keep them open, and change your perspective about honeybees.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
43098,46063,Notice that this man is not getting stung.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
46063,49507,"He probably has a queen bee tied to his chin,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
49507,51626,and the other bees are attracted to it.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
51626,55662,"So this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
55662,59430,and that goes deep back for thousands of years.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
59430,62592,"We're very co-evolved, because we depend on bees",R2kOgSVF2Uk
62592,65552,"for pollination and, even more recently,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
65552,67376,as an economic commodity.,R2kOgSVF2Uk

70176,72753,"not just dying, but they're gone.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
72753,74555,We don't even find dead bodies.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
74555,76926,"This is called colony collapse disorder,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
76926,79138,and it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe,R2kOgSVF2Uk
79138,81584,"still do not know what's causing it,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
81584,84154,"but what we do know is that, with the declining numbers",R2kOgSVF2Uk
84154,88391,"of bees, the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops",R2kOgSVF2Uk
88391,93398,that we rely on for food is going up in price.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
93398,97156,So honeybees are important for their role in the economy,R2kOgSVF2Uk
97156,99181,as well as in agriculture.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
99181,101000,Here you can see some pictures of what are called,R2kOgSVF2Uk
101000,103689,"green roofs, or urban agriculture.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
103689,105967,We're familiar with the image on the left that shows,R2kOgSVF2Uk
105967,108751,a local neighborhood garden in the South End.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
108751,111542,That's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
111542,113961,"And perhaps a green roof in the future,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
113961,115892,"when we're further utilizing urban areas,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
115892,119350,where there are stacks of garden spaces.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
119350,122703,Check out this image above the orange line in Boston.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
122703,126180,Try to spot the beehive. It's there.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
126180,128877,"It's on the rooftop, right on the corner there,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
128877,131270,and it's been there for a couple of years now.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
131270,134522,The way that urban beekeeping currently operates,R2kOgSVF2Uk
134522,137113,"is that the beehives are quite hidden,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
137113,139140,and it's not because they need to be.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
139140,142117,"It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
142117,145791,"and that's why I want you today to try to think about this,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
145791,148074,think about the benefits of bees in cities,R2kOgSVF2Uk
148074,150333,and why they really are a terrific thing.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
150333,153303,Let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
153303,155886,"So we know flowers, we know fruits and vegetables,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
155886,159092,even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock,R2kOgSVF2Uk
159092,161555,"for the meats that we eat, rely on pollinators,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
161555,164988,"but you've got male and female parts to a plant here,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
164988,167878,and basically pollinators are attracted to plants,R2kOgSVF2Uk
167878,170905,"for their nectar, and in the process,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
170905,174280,"a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
174280,177712,"or that male kind of sperm counterpart, along the way,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
177712,180330,"and then travel to different flowers, and eventually",R2kOgSVF2Uk
180330,183449,"an apple, in this case, will be produced.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
183449,185716,You can see the orientation. The stem is down.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
185716,188670,"The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
188670,191528,but that's a basic overview of how pollination works.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
191528,194400,"And let's think about urban living, not today,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
194400,197265,"and not in the past, but what about in a hundred years?",R2kOgSVF2Uk
197265,201203,What's it gonna look like? We have huge grand challenges,R2kOgSVF2Uk
201203,205133,"these days of habitat loss. We have more and more people,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
205133,208494,"billions of people, in 100 years, God knows how many people,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
208494,211858,"and how little space there will be to fit all of them,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
211858,215280,"so we need to change the way that we see cities, and",R2kOgSVF2Uk
215280,218643,"looking at this picture on the left of New York City today,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
218643,220510,you can see how gray and brown it is.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
220510,224041,We have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back,R2kOgSVF2Uk
224041,226077,"into the atmosphere,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
226077,228412,"contributing to global climate change, no doubt.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
228412,230912,"What about in 100 years, if we have green rooftops",R2kOgSVF2Uk
230912,234075,"everywhere, and gardening, and we create our own crops",R2kOgSVF2Uk
234075,237878,"right in the cities? We save on the costs of transportation,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
237878,241974,"we save on a healthier diet, and we also educate",R2kOgSVF2Uk
241974,243676,and create new jobs locally.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
243676,248342,We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
248342,251726,Here's some data that we collected through our company,R2kOgSVF2Uk
251726,254628,"with Best Bees, where we deliver, install and manage",R2kOgSVF2Uk
254628,256871,"honeybee hives for anybody who wants them,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
256871,260388,"in the city, in the countryside, and we introduce honeybees,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
260388,263247,and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop,R2kOgSVF2Uk
263247,265728,"or fire escape, for even that matter,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
265728,268502,and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
268502,270634,There's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed,R2kOgSVF2Uk
270634,274077,"in these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
274077,275477,overwintering survival.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
275477,278302,"Now this has been a huge problem for many years,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
278302,282362,"basically since the late 1980s, when the varroa mite came",R2kOgSVF2Uk
282362,285738,"and brought many different viruses, bacteria",R2kOgSVF2Uk
285738,287542,and fungal diseases with it.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
287542,289291,"Overwintering success is hard,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
289291,291584,"and that's when most of the colonies are lost,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
291584,294250,"and we found that in the cities, bees are surviving",R2kOgSVF2Uk
294250,296598,better than they are in the country.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
296598,298826,"A bit counterintuitive, right?",R2kOgSVF2Uk
298826,300908,"We think, oh, bees, countryside, agriculture,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
300908,303135,but that's not what the bees are showing.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
303135,305284,The bees like it in the city. (Laughter),R2kOgSVF2Uk
305284,308431,"Furthermore, they also produce more honey.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
308431,311000,The urban honey is delicious.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
311000,314097,"The bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
314097,316569,where we have hundreds of thousands of bees,R2kOgSVF2Uk
316569,318072,flying overheard right now,R2kOgSVF2Uk
318072,320377,"that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
320377,322687,are going to all of the local community gardens,R2kOgSVF2Uk
322687,325086,"and making delicious, healthy honey",R2kOgSVF2Uk
325086,328114,that just tastes like the flowers in our city.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
328114,332901,"So the yield for urban hives, in terms of honey production,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
332901,336016,"is higher as well as the overwintering survival,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
336016,337390,compared to rural areas.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
337390,339392,"Again, a bit counterintuitive.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
339392,342713,And looking back historically at the timeline,R2kOgSVF2Uk
342713,346989,"of honeybee health, we can go back to the year 950 and see",R2kOgSVF2Uk
346989,350037,that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
350037,353188,So the problems of bees today isn't necessarily,R2kOgSVF2Uk
353188,355813,something new. It has been happening,R2kOgSVF2Uk
355813,357880,"since over a thousand years ago,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
357880,361577,but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
361577,363605,So one thing I want to encourage you to think about,R2kOgSVF2Uk
363605,366007,is the idea of what an urban island is.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
366007,369403,You think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
369403,370982,Why are bees doing better in the city?,R2kOgSVF2Uk

318421,319860,I will die.,vwTDeT4v7RM

335212,337045,it's probably the same comfort,vwTDeT4v7RM
337045,338692,rating we've found in other,vwTDeT4v7RM

340188,341899,as non-comfortable.,vwTDeT4v7RM
341899,344043,So we sat together with a team,vwTDeT4v7RM
344043,346373,"which prepared the Bid Book, or goal,",vwTDeT4v7RM
346373,349148,"that we said, let's aim",vwTDeT4v7RM

351107,353750,"for outdoor comfort in this range,",vwTDeT4v7RM
353750,355421,which is perceived with a,vwTDeT4v7RM

358624,360245,"Celsius perceived temperature,",vwTDeT4v7RM
360245,362405,which is extremely comfortable.,vwTDeT4v7RM
362405,364998,People would feel really fine,vwTDeT4v7RM
364998,366892,in an open outdoor environment.,vwTDeT4v7RM
366892,368851,But what does it mean?,vwTDeT4v7RM
368851,370900,"If we just look on what happens,",vwTDeT4v7RM
370900,373011,"we see, temperature's too high.",vwTDeT4v7RM

377268,379371,we won't get much better.,vwTDeT4v7RM
379371,382092,So we need to do something active.,vwTDeT4v7RM
382092,383962,"We need, for instance, to bring",vwTDeT4v7RM
383962,386058,"in radiant cooling technology,",vwTDeT4v7RM
386058,387947,and we need to combine this,vwTDeT4v7RM
387947,390164,with so-called soft conditioning.,vwTDeT4v7RM
390164,391600,And how does it look like in a stadium?,vwTDeT4v7RM
391600,393928,So the stadium has a few,vwTDeT4v7RM
393928,395673,elements which create that,vwTDeT4v7RM
395673,396915,"outdoor comfort. First of all,",vwTDeT4v7RM
396915,399151,it's shading. It needs,vwTDeT4v7RM
399151,401465,to protect where the people,vwTDeT4v7RM
401465,403129,are sitting against strong,vwTDeT4v7RM
403129,404328,and warm wind.,vwTDeT4v7RM
404328,405967,But that's not all what we need,vwTDeT4v7RM
405967,408978,to do. We need to use,vwTDeT4v7RM
408978,411147,active systems.,vwTDeT4v7RM
411147,413587,Instead of blowing a hurricane,vwTDeT4v7RM
413587,415962,"of chilled air through the stadium,",vwTDeT4v7RM
415962,417710,we can use radiant,vwTDeT4v7RM
417710,419744,"cooling technologies, like a",vwTDeT4v7RM
419744,421944,floor heating system where water,vwTDeT4v7RM
421944,424327,pipes are embedded in the floor.,vwTDeT4v7RM
424327,426145,And just by using cold water,vwTDeT4v7RM
426145,427473,"going through the water pipes,",vwTDeT4v7RM
427473,429129,you can release the heat,vwTDeT4v7RM
429129,431209,which is absorbed during the day,vwTDeT4v7RM
431209,432446,"in the stadium, so you can",vwTDeT4v7RM
432446,434329,"create that comfort, and then by",vwTDeT4v7RM
434329,436889,adding dry air instead of,vwTDeT4v7RM
436889,439121,"down-chilled air, the spectators",vwTDeT4v7RM
439121,441003,and the football players can,vwTDeT4v7RM
441003,443336,adjust to their individual,vwTDeT4v7RM
443336,445113,"comfort needs, to their",vwTDeT4v7RM
445113,446769,individual energy balance.,vwTDeT4v7RM
446769,448746,They can adjust and find,vwTDeT4v7RM
448746,451121,their comfort they need to find.,vwTDeT4v7RM
451121,455577,There are 12 stadia probably,vwTDeT4v7RM
455577,457537,"to come, but there are",vwTDeT4v7RM
457537,459856,32 training pitches where,vwTDeT4v7RM
459856,461553,all the individual countries,vwTDeT4v7RM
461553,462737,are going to train.,vwTDeT4v7RM
462737,464634,We applied the same concept:,vwTDeT4v7RM
464634,466864,"shading of the training pitch,",vwTDeT4v7RM
466864,469704,"using a shelter against wind,",vwTDeT4v7RM
469704,471593,then using the grass.,vwTDeT4v7RM
471593,474113,Natural-watered lawn is a,vwTDeT4v7RM

475592,476809,"stabilizing temperature,",vwTDeT4v7RM

478745,479824,create comfort.,vwTDeT4v7RM
479824,483698,But even the best passive design,vwTDeT4v7RM
483698,484444,wouldn't help.,vwTDeT4v7RM
484444,485454,We need active system.,vwTDeT4v7RM
485454,486504,And how do we do that?,vwTDeT4v7RM
486504,488872,Our idea for the bid was,vwTDeT4v7RM
488872,490609,"100 percent solar cooling,",vwTDeT4v7RM

12509,16841,I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on,PB2OegI6wvI
16841,20404,involving a man named Steve Titus.,PB2OegI6wvI
20404,23433,Titus was a restaurant manager.,PB2OegI6wvI
23433,27523,"He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,",PB2OegI6wvI
27523,29418,"he was engaged to Gretchen,",PB2OegI6wvI
29418,32366,"about to be married, she was the love of his life.",PB2OegI6wvI
32366,34650,"And one night, the couple went out",PB2OegI6wvI
34650,37655,for a romantic restaurant meal.,PB2OegI6wvI
37655,39303,"They were on their way home,",PB2OegI6wvI
39303,42253,and they were pulled over by a police officer.,PB2OegI6wvI
42253,45570,"You see, Titus' car sort of resembled",PB2OegI6wvI
45570,49457,a car that was driven earlier in the evening,PB2OegI6wvI
49457,52863,"by a man who raped a female hitchhiker,",PB2OegI6wvI
52863,56457,and Titus kind of resembled that rapist.,PB2OegI6wvI
56457,59035,"So the police took a picture of Titus,",PB2OegI6wvI
59035,61802,"they put it in a photo lineup,",PB2OegI6wvI
61802,63962,"they later showed it to the victim,",PB2OegI6wvI
63962,66122,and she pointed to Titus' photo.,PB2OegI6wvI
66122,69743,"She said, That one's the closest.""""",PB2OegI6wvI
69743,73631,"The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,",PB2OegI6wvI
73631,76972,"and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,",PB2OegI6wvI
76972,79068,the rape victim got on the stand,PB2OegI6wvI
79068,83410,"and said, I'm absolutely positive that's the man.""""",PB2OegI6wvI
83410,86336,And Titus was convicted.,PB2OegI6wvI
86336,88310,"He proclaimed his innocence,",PB2OegI6wvI
88310,90892,"his family screamed at the jury,",PB2OegI6wvI
90892,93763,"his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,",PB2OegI6wvI
93763,97158,and Titus is taken away to jail.,PB2OegI6wvI
97158,100616,So what would you do at this point?,PB2OegI6wvI
100616,102252,What would you do?,PB2OegI6wvI
102252,106020,"Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,",PB2OegI6wvI
106020,108052,and yet he got an idea.,PB2OegI6wvI
108052,110483,"He called up the local newspaper,",PB2OegI6wvI
110483,113870,"he got the interest of an investigative journalist,",PB2OegI6wvI
113870,118606,"and that journalist actually found the real rapist,",PB2OegI6wvI
118606,121959,"a man who ultimately confessed to this rape,",PB2OegI6wvI
121959,125251,a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes,PB2OegI6wvI
125251,126583,"in that area,",PB2OegI6wvI
126583,129757,"and when this information was given to the judge,",PB2OegI6wvI
129757,132693,the judge set Titus free.,PB2OegI6wvI
132693,136724,"And really, that's where this case should have ended.",PB2OegI6wvI
136724,137847,It should have been over.,PB2OegI6wvI
137847,140367,"Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year,",PB2OegI6wvI
140367,144203,"a year of accusation and trial, but over.",PB2OegI6wvI
144203,146250,It didn't end that way.,PB2OegI6wvI
146250,148928,Titus was so bitter.,PB2OegI6wvI
148928,151508,He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.,PB2OegI6wvI
151508,153351,He lost his fiancée.,PB2OegI6wvI
153351,156257,She couldn't put up with his persistent anger.,PB2OegI6wvI
156257,158403,"He lost his entire savings,",PB2OegI6wvI
158403,161261,and so he decided to file a lawsuit,PB2OegI6wvI
161261,163542,against the police and others whom he felt,PB2OegI6wvI
163542,165861,were responsible for his suffering.,PB2OegI6wvI
165861,170574,"And that's when I really started working on this case,",PB2OegI6wvI
170574,172535,trying to figure out,PB2OegI6wvI
172535,174609,how did that victim go from,PB2OegI6wvI
174609,176137,"That one's the closest""""",PB2OegI6wvI
176137,180887,"to I'm absolutely positive that's the guy.""""",PB2OegI6wvI
180887,184166,"Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case.",PB2OegI6wvI
184166,187200,"He spent every waking moment thinking about it,",PB2OegI6wvI
187200,191351,"and just days before he was to have his day in court,",PB2OegI6wvI
191351,193570,"he woke up in the morning,",PB2OegI6wvI
193570,195378,"doubled over in pain,",PB2OegI6wvI
195378,198072,and died of a stress-related heart attack.,PB2OegI6wvI
198072,201259,He was 35 years old.,PB2OegI6wvI
201259,206069,So I was asked to work on Titus' case,PB2OegI6wvI
206069,208584,because I'm a psychological scientist.,PB2OegI6wvI
208584,212411,I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.,PB2OegI6wvI

302598,304839,many people believe that memory,PB2OegI6wvI

327613,332726,"You can go in there and change it, but so can other people.",PB2OegI6wvI
332726,337975,I first started studying this constructive memory process,PB2OegI6wvI
337975,340390,in the 1970s.,PB2OegI6wvI
340390,344813,I did my experiments that involved showing people,PB2OegI6wvI

478259,480560,And so what these studies are showing,PB2OegI6wvI
480560,484420,is that when you feed people misinformation,PB2OegI6wvI
484420,487800,"about some experience that they may have had,",PB2OegI6wvI
487800,493455,you can distort or contaminate or change their memory.,PB2OegI6wvI
493455,495655,"Well out there in the real world,",PB2OegI6wvI
495655,498546,misinformation is everywhere.,PB2OegI6wvI
498546,499906,We get misinformation,PB2OegI6wvI
499906,502822,"not only if we're questioned in a leading way,",PB2OegI6wvI
502822,505269,but if we talk to other witnesses,PB2OegI6wvI
505269,508302,who might consciously or inadvertently feed us,PB2OegI6wvI
508302,510439,"some erroneous information,",PB2OegI6wvI
510439,515169,"or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,",PB2OegI6wvI
515169,517962,all of these provide the opportunity,PB2OegI6wvI
517962,522312,for this kind of contamination of our memory.,PB2OegI6wvI
522312,526100,"In the 1990s, we began to see",PB2OegI6wvI
526100,530783,an even more extreme kind of memory problem.,PB2OegI6wvI
530783,533879,Some patients were going into therapy with one problem --,PB2OegI6wvI
533879,536793,"maybe they had depression, an eating disorder --",PB2OegI6wvI
536793,539546,and they were coming out of therapy,PB2OegI6wvI
539546,542207,with a different problem.,PB2OegI6wvI
542207,545908,"Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations,",PB2OegI6wvI
545908,547891,"sometimes in satanic rituals,",PB2OegI6wvI
547891,552588,sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.,PB2OegI6wvI
552588,555142,One woman came out of psychotherapy,PB2OegI6wvI
555142,557570,believing that she'd endured years,PB2OegI6wvI
557570,561472,"of ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy",PB2OegI6wvI
561472,564038,and that the baby was cut from her belly.,PB2OegI6wvI
564038,566397,But there were no physical scars,PB2OegI6wvI
566397,568423,or any kind of physical evidence,PB2OegI6wvI
568423,571304,that could have supported her story.,PB2OegI6wvI
571304,574312,"And when I began looking into these cases,",PB2OegI6wvI
574312,575762,"I was wondering,",PB2OegI6wvI
575762,578090,where do these bizarre memories come from?,PB2OegI6wvI
578090,582477,And what I found is that most of these situations,PB2OegI6wvI
582477,587968,involved some particular form of psychotherapy.,PB2OegI6wvI
587968,589567,"And so I asked,",PB2OegI6wvI
589567,592955,were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy --,PB2OegI6wvI
592955,595839,like the imagination exercises,PB2OegI6wvI
595839,597896,"or dream interpretation,",PB2OegI6wvI
597896,600028,"or in some cases hypnosis,",PB2OegI6wvI
600028,603846,or in some cases exposure to false information --,PB2OegI6wvI
603846,606633,were these leading these patients,PB2OegI6wvI
606633,609310,"to develop these very bizarre,",PB2OegI6wvI
609310,612241,unlikely memories?,PB2OegI6wvI
612241,614400,And I designed some experiments,PB2OegI6wvI
614400,619425,to try to study the processes that were being used,PB2OegI6wvI
619425,622498,in this psychotherapy so I could study,PB2OegI6wvI
622498,626049,the development of these very rich false memories.,PB2OegI6wvI
626049,628457,"In one of the first studies we did,",PB2OegI6wvI
628457,630810,"we used suggestion,",PB2OegI6wvI
630810,634873,"a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,",PB2OegI6wvI
634873,636983,we used this kind of suggestion,PB2OegI6wvI
636983,638835,and planted a false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
638835,641912,"that when you were a kid, five or six years old,",PB2OegI6wvI
641912,644163,you were lost in a shopping mall.,PB2OegI6wvI
644163,646663,You were frightened. You were crying.,PB2OegI6wvI
646663,649177,You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person,PB2OegI6wvI
649177,651029,and reunited with the family.,PB2OegI6wvI
651029,653637,And we succeeded in planting this memory,PB2OegI6wvI
653637,657743,in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.,PB2OegI6wvI
657743,659748,"And you might be thinking, well,",PB2OegI6wvI
659748,662094,that's not particularly stressful.,PB2OegI6wvI
662094,665463,But we and other investigators have planted,PB2OegI6wvI
665463,668221,rich false memories of things that were,PB2OegI6wvI
668221,671136,much more unusual and much more stressful.,PB2OegI6wvI
671136,673675,"So in a study done in Tennessee,",PB2OegI6wvI
673675,676091,researchers planted the false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
676091,678665,"that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned",PB2OegI6wvI
678665,681172,and had to be rescued by a life guard.,PB2OegI6wvI
681172,683475,"And in a study done in Canada,",PB2OegI6wvI
683475,685999,researchers planted the false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
685999,687227,"that when you were a kid,",PB2OegI6wvI
687227,690957,something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal,PB2OegI6wvI
690957,692339,"happened to you,",PB2OegI6wvI
692339,695761,succeeding with about half of their subjects.,PB2OegI6wvI
695761,698113,"And in a study done in Italy,",PB2OegI6wvI
698113,700771,"researchers planted the false memory,",PB2OegI6wvI
700771,705983,"when you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.",PB2OegI6wvI
705983,708190,I do want to add that it might seem,PB2OegI6wvI
708190,711929,like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects,PB2OegI6wvI
711929,713529,"in the name of science,",PB2OegI6wvI
713529,718167,but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation,PB2OegI6wvI
718167,720142,by research ethics boards,PB2OegI6wvI
720142,722484,that have made the decision,PB2OegI6wvI
722484,725557,that the temporary discomfort that some,PB2OegI6wvI
725557,728641,of these subjects might experience in these studies,PB2OegI6wvI
728641,732541,is outweighed by the importance of this problem,PB2OegI6wvI
732541,735648,for understanding memory processes,PB2OegI6wvI
735648,738994,and the abuse of memory that is going on,PB2OegI6wvI
738994,742287,in some places in the world.,PB2OegI6wvI
742287,745325,"Well, to my surprise,",PB2OegI6wvI
745325,748754,when I published this work and began to speak out,PB2OegI6wvI
748754,752649,"against this particular brand of psychotherapy,",PB2OegI6wvI
752649,756629,it created some pretty bad problems for me:,PB2OegI6wvI
756629,761530,"hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,",PB2OegI6wvI
761530,763206,"who felt under attack,",PB2OegI6wvI
763206,766734,and by the patients whom they had influenced.,PB2OegI6wvI
766734,769671,I had sometimes armed guards at speeches,PB2OegI6wvI
769671,771576,"that I was invited to give,",PB2OegI6wvI
771576,775793,people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.,PB2OegI6wvI
775793,777774,But probably the worst,PB2OegI6wvI
777774,780541,was I suspected that a woman,PB2OegI6wvI
780541,782965,was innocent of abuse,PB2OegI6wvI
782965,785801,that was being claimed by her grown daughter.,PB2OegI6wvI
785801,789218,She accused her mother of sexual abuse,PB2OegI6wvI
789218,791077,based on a repressed memory.,PB2OegI6wvI
791077,793960,And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story,PB2OegI6wvI
793960,797394,to be filmed and presented in public places.,PB2OegI6wvI
797394,799903,"I was suspicious of this story,",PB2OegI6wvI
799903,802203,"and so I started to investigate,",PB2OegI6wvI
802203,806686,and eventually found information that convinced me,PB2OegI6wvI
806686,808975,that this mother was innocent.,PB2OegI6wvI
808975,811936,"I published an exposé on the case,",PB2OegI6wvI
811936,815380,"and a little while later, the accusing daughter",PB2OegI6wvI
815380,816901,filed a lawsuit.,PB2OegI6wvI
816901,819256,"Even though I'd never mentioned her name,",PB2OegI6wvI
819256,823618,she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.,PB2OegI6wvI
823618,826341,And I went through nearly five years,PB2OegI6wvI
826341,832893,"of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,",PB2OegI6wvI
832893,836567,"but finally, finally, it was over and I could really",PB2OegI6wvI
836567,838991,get back to my work.,PB2OegI6wvI
838991,841476,"In the process, however, I became part",PB2OegI6wvI
841476,844130,of a disturbing trend in America,PB2OegI6wvI
844130,846237,where scientists are being sued,PB2OegI6wvI
846237,850836,for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.,PB2OegI6wvI
850836,854194,"When I got back to my work, I asked this question:",PB2OegI6wvI
854194,856592,"if I plant a false memory in your mind,",PB2OegI6wvI
856592,858436,does it have repercussions?,PB2OegI6wvI
858436,860395,"Does it affect your later thoughts,",PB2OegI6wvI
860395,862496,your later behaviors?,PB2OegI6wvI
862496,864523,Our first study planted a false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
864523,867849,that you got sick as a child eating certain foods:,PB2OegI6wvI
867849,870848,"hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.",PB2OegI6wvI
870848,874038,"And we found that once we planted this false memory,",PB2OegI6wvI
874038,876489,people didn't want to eat the foods as much,PB2OegI6wvI
876489,878749,at an outdoor picnic.,PB2OegI6wvI
878749,882622,The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.,PB2OegI6wvI
882622,884980,"If we planted a warm, fuzzy memory",PB2OegI6wvI
884980,888001,"involving a healthy food like asparagus,",PB2OegI6wvI
888001,891476,we could get people to want to eat asparagus more.,PB2OegI6wvI
891476,893850,And so what these studies are showing,PB2OegI6wvI
893850,895965,is that you can plant false memories,PB2OegI6wvI
895965,897378,and they have repercussions,PB2OegI6wvI
897378,902463,that affect behavior long after the memories take hold.,PB2OegI6wvI
902463,904887,"Well, along with this ability",PB2OegI6wvI
904887,907810,to plant memories and control behavior,PB2OegI6wvI
907810,911991,"obviously come some important ethical issues,",PB2OegI6wvI
911991,915050,"like, when should we use this mind technology?",PB2OegI6wvI
915050,918730,And should we ever ban its use?,PB2OegI6wvI
918730,921513,Therapists can't ethically plant false memories,PB2OegI6wvI
921513,923100,in the mind of their patients,PB2OegI6wvI
923100,925664,"even if it would help the patient,",PB2OegI6wvI
925664,927286,but there's nothing to stop a parent,PB2OegI6wvI
927286,931735,from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.,PB2OegI6wvI
931735,934340,"And when I suggested this publicly,",PB2OegI6wvI

958523,960055,"all the things that go with it,",PB2OegI6wvI
960055,963071,or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?,PB2OegI6wvI
963071,966462,I know what I would choose for a kid of mine.,PB2OegI6wvI

976697,979555,And I appreciate that. I feel that way too.,PB2OegI6wvI
979555,981760,But I know from my work,PB2OegI6wvI
981760,986241,how much fiction is already in there.,PB2OegI6wvI

1007675,1011223,We need independent corroboration.,PB2OegI6wvI
