15260,18260,How do you observe something you can't see?,c8re1U9rCo4
18260,21260,This is the basic question of somebody who's interested,c8re1U9rCo4
21260,23260,in finding and studying black holes.,c8re1U9rCo4
23260,25260,Because black holes are objects,c8re1U9rCo4
25260,28260,whose pull of gravity is so intense,c8re1U9rCo4
28260,30260,"that nothing can escape it, not even light,",c8re1U9rCo4
30260,32260,so you can't see it directly.,c8re1U9rCo4
32260,35260,"So, my story today about black holes",c8re1U9rCo4
35260,37260,is about one particular black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
37260,40260,I'm interested in finding whether or not,c8re1U9rCo4
40260,43260,"there is a really massive, what we like to call",c8re1U9rCo4
43260,46260,"supermassive"" black hole at the center of our galaxy.""",c8re1U9rCo4
46260,49260,And the reason this is interesting is that,c8re1U9rCo4
49260,52260,it gives us an opportunity to prove,c8re1U9rCo4
52260,56260,whether or not these exotic objects really exist.,c8re1U9rCo4
56260,58260,"And second, it gives us the opportunity",c8re1U9rCo4
58260,61260,to understand how these supermassive black holes,c8re1U9rCo4
61260,63260,"interact with their environment,",c8re1U9rCo4
63260,66260,and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution,c8re1U9rCo4
66260,69260,of the galaxies which they reside in.,c8re1U9rCo4
69260,71260,"So, to begin with,",c8re1U9rCo4
71260,74260,we need to understand what a black hole is,c8re1U9rCo4
74260,76260,so we can understand the proof of a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
76260,78260,"So, what is a black hole?",c8re1U9rCo4
78260,82260,"Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object,",c8re1U9rCo4
82260,85260,because there are only three characteristics that you can describe:,c8re1U9rCo4
85260,87260,"the mass,",c8re1U9rCo4
87260,89260,"the spin, and the charge.",c8re1U9rCo4
89260,91260,And I'm going to only talk about the mass.,c8re1U9rCo4
91260,94260,"So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.",c8re1U9rCo4
94260,96260,"But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object",c8re1U9rCo4
96260,99260,"that we need relatively exotic physics to describe,",c8re1U9rCo4
99260,103260,and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding,c8re1U9rCo4
103260,105260,of the universe.,c8re1U9rCo4
105260,107260,"But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
107260,109260,"for the proof of a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
109260,111260,is to think of it as an object,c8re1U9rCo4
111260,114260,whose mass is confined to zero volume.,c8re1U9rCo4
114260,116260,"So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about",c8re1U9rCo4
116260,119260,"an object that's supermassive,",c8re1U9rCo4
119260,121260,"and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment,",c8re1U9rCo4
121260,124260,it has no finite size.,c8re1U9rCo4
124260,126260,"So, this is a little tricky.",c8re1U9rCo4
126260,130260,"But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see,",c8re1U9rCo4
130260,133260,and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
133260,135260,And that's named after the guy who recognized,c8re1U9rCo4
135260,137260,why it was such an important radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
137260,140260,"This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.",c8re1U9rCo4
140260,142260,So why is it so important?,c8re1U9rCo4
142260,144260,It's important because it tells us,c8re1U9rCo4
144260,148260,that any object can become a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
148260,151260,"That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,",c8re1U9rCo4
151260,153260,the auditorium can become a black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
153260,156260,if you can figure out how to compress it down,c8re1U9rCo4
156260,158260,to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
158260,161260,"At that point, what's going to happen?",c8re1U9rCo4
161260,163260,At that point gravity wins.,c8re1U9rCo4
163260,165260,Gravity wins over all other known forces.,c8re1U9rCo4
165260,168260,And the object is forced to continue to collapse,c8re1U9rCo4
168260,170260,to an infinitely small object.,c8re1U9rCo4
170260,172260,And then it's a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
172260,177260,"So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,",c8re1U9rCo4
177260,179260,"it would become a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
179260,183260,because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
183260,186260,"Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.",c8re1U9rCo4
186260,190260,And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.,c8re1U9rCo4
190260,192260,It depends only on the mass of the object.,c8re1U9rCo4
192260,194260,Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.,c8re1U9rCo4
194260,197260,Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.,c8re1U9rCo4
197260,199260,"So, if I were to take the sun",c8re1U9rCo4
199260,202260,"and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,",c8re1U9rCo4
202260,205260,it would become a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
205260,208260,"So, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.",c8re1U9rCo4
208260,210260,"And it's actually quite a useful concept,",c8re1U9rCo4
210260,212260,because it tells us not only,c8re1U9rCo4
212260,214260,"when a black hole will form,",c8re1U9rCo4
214260,217260,but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
217260,219260,I only need two things.,c8re1U9rCo4
219260,221260,I need to understand the mass of the object,c8re1U9rCo4
221260,223260,"I'm claiming is a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
223260,225260,and what its Schwarzschild radius is.,c8re1U9rCo4
225260,227260,"And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,",c8re1U9rCo4
227260,229260,there is actually only one thing I really need to know.,c8re1U9rCo4
229260,231260,"So, my job in convincing you",c8re1U9rCo4
231260,233260,that there is a black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
233260,235260,is to show that there is some object,c8re1U9rCo4
235260,238260,that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
238260,241260,And your job today is to be skeptical.,c8re1U9rCo4
241260,245260,"Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;",c8re1U9rCo4
245260,248260,I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.,c8re1U9rCo4
248260,250260,"So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,",c8re1U9rCo4
250260,253260,as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
253260,256260,An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state,c8re1U9rCo4
256260,258260,of a really massive star's life.,c8re1U9rCo4
258260,260260,"So, if a star starts its life off",c8re1U9rCo4
260260,262260,"with much more mass than the mass of the Sun,",c8re1U9rCo4
262260,265260,it's going to end its life by exploding,c8re1U9rCo4
265260,268260,and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.,c8re1U9rCo4
268260,270260,And inside that supernova remnant,c8re1U9rCo4
270260,272260,is going to be a little black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
272260,275260,that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.,c8re1U9rCo4
275260,277260,On an astronomical scale,c8re1U9rCo4
277260,279260,that's a very small black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
279260,282260,"Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.",c8re1U9rCo4
282260,286260,And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.,c8re1U9rCo4
286260,289260,And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope,c8re1U9rCo4
289260,292260,shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.,c8re1U9rCo4
292260,294260,There are big ones. There are little ones.,c8re1U9rCo4
294260,297260,Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
297260,300260,And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.,c8re1U9rCo4
300260,304260,"And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
304260,306260,just to give you a sense of scale.,c8re1U9rCo4
306260,308260,"And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
308260,310260,"which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,",c8re1U9rCo4
310260,312260,comes from the light from the stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
312260,314260,"So, we see the galaxy because of the star light.",c8re1U9rCo4
314260,318260,"Now, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.",c8re1U9rCo4
318260,321260,"I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,",c8re1U9rCo4
321260,323260,because they are kind of show offs.,c8re1U9rCo4
323260,325260,And we call them active galactic nuclei.,c8re1U9rCo4
325260,327260,"And we call them that because their nucleus,",c8re1U9rCo4
327260,330260,"or their center, are very active.",c8re1U9rCo4
330260,332260,"So, at the center there, that's actually where",c8re1U9rCo4
332260,334260,most of the starlight comes out from.,c8re1U9rCo4
334260,336260,"And yet, what we actually see is light",c8re1U9rCo4
336260,339260,that can't be explained by the starlight.,c8re1U9rCo4
339260,341260,It's way more energetic.,c8re1U9rCo4
341260,343260,"In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.",c8re1U9rCo4
343260,346260,There are also jets emanating out from the center.,c8re1U9rCo4
346260,350260,"Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain",c8re1U9rCo4
350260,352260,if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
352260,354260,"So, what people have thought is that perhaps",c8re1U9rCo4
354260,357260,there are supermassive black holes,c8re1U9rCo4
357260,360260,which matter is falling on to.,c8re1U9rCo4
360260,362260,"So, you can't see the black hole itself,",c8re1U9rCo4
362260,365260,but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
365260,367260,into the light we see.,c8re1U9rCo4
367260,369260,"So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes",c8re1U9rCo4
369260,371260,exist at the center of galaxies.,c8re1U9rCo4
371260,373260,But it's a kind of indirect argument.,c8re1U9rCo4
373260,375260,"Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion",c8re1U9rCo4
375260,378260,that maybe it's not just these prima donnas,c8re1U9rCo4
378260,380260,"that have these supermassive black holes,",c8re1U9rCo4
380260,383260,but rather all galaxies might harbor these,c8re1U9rCo4
383260,385260,supermassive black holes at their centers.,c8re1U9rCo4
385260,388260,And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy;,c8re1U9rCo4
388260,390260,what we see is the star light.,c8re1U9rCo4
390260,392260,"And if there is a supermassive black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
392260,395260,what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.,c8re1U9rCo4
395260,398260,Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see,c8re1U9rCo4
398260,401260,in active galactic nuclei.,c8re1U9rCo4
401260,404260,If we're going to look for these stealth black holes,c8re1U9rCo4
404260,406260,"at the center of galaxies,",c8re1U9rCo4
406260,410260,"the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.",c8re1U9rCo4
410260,412260,And this is a wide field picture,c8re1U9rCo4
412260,415260,taken of the center of the Milky Way.,c8re1U9rCo4
415260,418260,And what we see is a line of stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
418260,420260,And that is because we live in a galaxy which has,c8re1U9rCo4
420260,422260,"a flattened, disk-like structure.",c8re1U9rCo4
422260,424260,"And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,",c8re1U9rCo4
424260,426260,"we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
426260,430260,or line that defines the plane of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
430260,433260,"Now, the advantage of studying our own galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
433260,436260,is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy,c8re1U9rCo4
436260,438260,"that we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
438260,441260,is 100 times further away.,c8re1U9rCo4
441260,443260,"So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
443260,445260,than anyplace else.,c8re1U9rCo4
445260,447260,"And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail",c8re1U9rCo4
447260,450260,is key to this experiment.,c8re1U9rCo4
450260,453260,"So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass",c8re1U9rCo4
453260,455260,inside a small volume?,c8re1U9rCo4
455260,458260,Which is the job that I have to show you today.,c8re1U9rCo4
458260,460260,And the tool that we use is to watch the way,c8re1U9rCo4
460260,463260,stars orbit the black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
463260,465260,Stars will orbit the black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
465260,468260,in the very same way that planets orbit the sun.,c8re1U9rCo4
468260,470260,It's the gravitational pull,c8re1U9rCo4
470260,472260,that makes these things orbit.,c8re1U9rCo4
472260,475260,"If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,",c8re1U9rCo4
475260,477260,or at least go at a much slower rate,c8re1U9rCo4
477260,480260,because all that determines how they go around,c8re1U9rCo4
480260,482260,is how much mass is inside its orbit.,c8re1U9rCo4
482260,484260,"So, this is great, because remember my job is to show",c8re1U9rCo4
484260,486260,there is a lot of mass inside a small volume.,c8re1U9rCo4
486260,489260,"So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.",c8re1U9rCo4
489260,492260,And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
492260,494260,"So, I want to see the stars",c8re1U9rCo4
494260,496260,that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.,c8re1U9rCo4
496260,500260,Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.,c8re1U9rCo4
500260,503260,"So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.",c8re1U9rCo4
503260,505260,And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used,c8re1U9rCo4
505260,507260,the world's largest telescope.,c8re1U9rCo4
507260,510260,This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes,c8re1U9rCo4
510260,512260,"with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly",c8re1U9rCo4
512260,514260,the diameter of a tennis court.,c8re1U9rCo4
514260,516260,"Now, this is wonderful,",c8re1U9rCo4
516260,518260,because the campaign promise,c8re1U9rCo4
518260,521260,"of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,",c8re1U9rCo4
521260,525260,the smaller the detail that we can see.,c8re1U9rCo4
525260,528260,"But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground",c8re1U9rCo4
528260,532260,has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.,c8re1U9rCo4
532260,534260,And that is because of the atmosphere.,c8re1U9rCo4
534260,536260,Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us,c8re1U9rCo4
536260,538260,to survive here on Earth.,c8re1U9rCo4
538260,541260,But it's relatively challenging for astronomers,c8re1U9rCo4
541260,545260,who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.,c8re1U9rCo4
545260,547260,"So, to give you a sense of what this is like,",c8re1U9rCo4
547260,549260,it's actually like looking at a pebble,c8re1U9rCo4
549260,551260,at the bottom of a stream.,c8re1U9rCo4
551260,553260,"Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,",c8re1U9rCo4
553260,556260,"the stream is continuously moving and turbulent,",c8re1U9rCo4
556260,560260,and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.,c8re1U9rCo4
560260,562260,"Very much in the same way, it's very difficult",c8re1U9rCo4
562260,564260,"to see astronomical sources, because of the",c8re1U9rCo4
564260,566260,atmosphere that's continuously moving by.,c8re1U9rCo4
566260,569260,"So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways",c8re1U9rCo4
569260,572260,"to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.",c8re1U9rCo4
572260,575260,And that buys us about a factor of 20.,c8re1U9rCo4
575260,577260,And I think all of you can agree that if you can,c8re1U9rCo4
577260,580260,"figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,",c8re1U9rCo4
580260,582260,"you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,",c8re1U9rCo4
582260,587260,"say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.",c8re1U9rCo4
587260,589260,And this animation here shows you one example of,c8re1U9rCo4
589260,592260,"the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.",c8re1U9rCo4
592260,594260,You're seeing an animation that goes between,c8re1U9rCo4
594260,597260,an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique --,c8re1U9rCo4
597260,600260,"in other words, just a picture that shows the stars --",c8re1U9rCo4
600260,602260,"and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
602260,604260,where we think the black hole is.,c8re1U9rCo4
604260,607260,"So, without this technology you can't see the stars.",c8re1U9rCo4
607260,609260,With this technology all of a sudden you can see it.,c8re1U9rCo4
609260,611260,This technology works by introducing a mirror,c8re1U9rCo4
611260,613260,into the telescope optics system,c8re1U9rCo4
613260,618260,that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.,c8re1U9rCo4
618260,622260,"So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.",c8re1U9rCo4
622260,624260,"Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on",c8re1U9rCo4
624260,626260,that little square there.,c8re1U9rCo4
626260,628260,"So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,",c8re1U9rCo4
628260,630260,although we've looked at all of them.,c8re1U9rCo4
630260,632260,"So, I want to see how these things have moved.",c8re1U9rCo4
632260,634260,"And over the course of this experiment, these stars",c8re1U9rCo4
634260,636260,have moved a tremendous amount.,c8re1U9rCo4
636260,638260,"So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,",c8re1U9rCo4
638260,640260,and we see the stars go all the way around.,c8re1U9rCo4
640260,643260,"Now, most astronomers have a favorite star,",c8re1U9rCo4
643260,647260,"and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.",c8re1U9rCo4
647260,649260,Absolutely my favorite star in the world.,c8re1U9rCo4
649260,652260,And that's because it goes around in only 15 years.,c8re1U9rCo4
652260,654260,"And to give you a sense of how short that is,",c8re1U9rCo4
654260,659260,the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
659260,662260,"Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
662260,664260,"as possible, take 500 years.",c8re1U9rCo4
664260,668260,"And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.",c8re1U9rCo4
668260,670260,"That's kind of profound, in a way.",c8re1U9rCo4
670260,672260,But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me,c8re1U9rCo4
672260,676260,how much mass is inside a very small radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
676260,679260,"So, next we see a picture here that shows you",c8re1U9rCo4
679260,681260,before this experiment the size to which we could,c8re1U9rCo4
681260,684260,confine the mass of the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
684260,686260,What we knew before is that there was four million,c8re1U9rCo4
686260,689260,times the mass of the sun inside that circle.,c8re1U9rCo4
689260,691260,"And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.",c8re1U9rCo4
691260,693260,You can see a lot of stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
693260,695260,"So, there was actually lots of alternatives",c8re1U9rCo4
695260,698260,"to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
698260,700260,because you could put a lot of stuff in there.,c8re1U9rCo4
700260,702260,"But with this experiment, we've confined",c8re1U9rCo4
702260,705260,that same mass to a much smaller volume,c8re1U9rCo4
705260,709260,"that's 10,000 times smaller.",c8re1U9rCo4
709260,711260,"And because of that, we've been able to show",c8re1U9rCo4
711260,713260,that there is a supermassive black hole there.,c8re1U9rCo4
713260,715260,"To give you a sense of how small that size is,",c8re1U9rCo4
715260,717260,that's the size of our solar system.,c8re1U9rCo4
717260,721260,"So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun",c8re1U9rCo4
721260,723260,into that small volume.,c8re1U9rCo4
723260,726260,"Now, truth in advertising. Right?",c8re1U9rCo4
726260,729260,I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
729260,731260,"And the truth is, I'm not quite there.",c8re1U9rCo4
731260,733260,But we actually have no alternative today,c8re1U9rCo4
733260,736260,to explaining this concentration of mass.,c8re1U9rCo4
736260,739260,"And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date",c8re1U9rCo4
739260,741260,for not only existence of a supermassive black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
741260,744260,"at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.",c8re1U9rCo4
744260,747260,"So, what next? I actually think",c8re1U9rCo4
747260,749260,"this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,",c8re1U9rCo4
749260,751260,so let's move on with the problem.,c8re1U9rCo4
751260,753260,"So, what I want to tell you, very briefly,",c8re1U9rCo4
753260,755260,is a few examples,c8re1U9rCo4
755260,757260,of the excitement of what we can do today,c8re1U9rCo4
757260,759260,"at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,",c8re1U9rCo4
759260,761260,"or at least we believe,",c8re1U9rCo4
761260,763260,that there is a supermassive black hole there.,c8re1U9rCo4
763260,765260,And the fun phase of this experiment,c8re1U9rCo4
765260,768260,"is, while we've tested some of our ideas",c8re1U9rCo4
768260,770260,about the consequences of a supermassive black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
770260,772260,"being at the center of our galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
772260,774260,almost every single one,c8re1U9rCo4
774260,776260,has been inconsistent with what we actually see.,c8re1U9rCo4
776260,778260,And that's the fun.,c8re1U9rCo4
778260,780260,"So, let me give you the two examples.",c8re1U9rCo4
780260,782260,"You can ask, What do you expect""",c8re1U9rCo4
782260,784260,"for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
784260,788260,"for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.""
305;788260;790260;What you expect there is that old stars""",c8re1U9rCo4
790260,792260,should be very clustered around the black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
792260,796260,You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
796260,800260,"Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,",c8re1U9rCo4
800260,802260,they just should not be there.,c8re1U9rCo4
802260,806260,A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.,c8re1U9rCo4
806260,810260,"To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.",c8re1U9rCo4
810260,812260,And it's a very fragile entity.,c8re1U9rCo4
812260,814260,And what does the big black hole do?,c8re1U9rCo4
814260,816260,It strips that gas cloud apart.,c8re1U9rCo4
816260,818260,It pulls much stronger on one side than the other,c8re1U9rCo4
818260,820260,and the cloud is stripped apart.,c8re1U9rCo4
820260,823260,"In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.",c8re1U9rCo4
823260,825260,"So, you shouldn't see young stars.",c8re1U9rCo4
825260,827260,"So, what do we see?",c8re1U9rCo4
827260,829260,"Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,",c8re1U9rCo4
829260,832260,we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.,c8re1U9rCo4
832260,834260,The old ones are red.,c8re1U9rCo4
834260,837260,"The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.",c8re1U9rCo4
837260,839260,"So, you can already see the surprise.",c8re1U9rCo4
839260,841260,There is a dearth of old stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
841260,845260,"There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.",c8re1U9rCo4
845260,847260,"So, this is the fun part.",c8re1U9rCo4
847260,849260,"And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,",c8re1U9rCo4
849260,851260,this mystery of how do you get --,c8re1U9rCo4
851260,853260,how do you resolve this contradiction.,c8re1U9rCo4
853260,855260,"So, in fact, my graduate students",c8re1U9rCo4
855260,859260,"are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,",c8re1U9rCo4
859260,862260,"in Hawaii, making observations to get us",c8re1U9rCo4
862260,864260,"hopefully to the next stage,",c8re1U9rCo4
864260,866260,where we can address this question,c8re1U9rCo4
866260,868260,"of why are there so many young stars,",c8re1U9rCo4
868260,870260,and so few old stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
870260,872260,To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits,c8re1U9rCo4
872260,874260,of stars that are much further away.,c8re1U9rCo4
874260,876260,To do that we'll probably need much more,c8re1U9rCo4
876260,878260,sophisticated technology than we have today.,c8re1U9rCo4
878260,880260,"Because, in truth, while I said we're correcting",c8re1U9rCo4
880260,882260,"for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only",c8re1U9rCo4
882260,884260,correct for half the errors that are introduced.,c8re1U9rCo4
884260,887260,"We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,",c8re1U9rCo4
887260,890260,and what we think we can do is if we,c8re1U9rCo4
890260,892260,shine a few more that we can correct the rest.,c8re1U9rCo4
892260,894260,So this is what we hope to do in the next few years.,c8re1U9rCo4
894260,896260,"And on a much longer time scale,",c8re1U9rCo4
896260,899260,"what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,",c8re1U9rCo4
899260,902260,"because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.",c8re1U9rCo4
902260,904260,"So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.",c8re1U9rCo4
904260,906260,And with this telescope we should be able to see,c8re1U9rCo4
906260,909260,stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
909260,911260,And we hope to be able to test some of,c8re1U9rCo4
911260,914260,"Einstein's theories of general relativity,",c8re1U9rCo4
914260,917260,some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.,c8re1U9rCo4
917260,919260,"So, we think the future of this experiment",c8re1U9rCo4
919260,922260,is quite exciting.,c8re1U9rCo4
922260,924260,"So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation",c8re1U9rCo4
924260,926260,that basically shows you how these,c8re1U9rCo4
926260,929260,"orbits have been moving, in three dimensions.",c8re1U9rCo4
929260,931260,"And I hope, if nothing else,",c8re1U9rCo4
931260,933260,"I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact",c8re1U9rCo4
933260,936260,have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
936260,939260,"And this means that these things do exist in our universe,",c8re1U9rCo4
939260,941260,"and we have to contend with this, we have to explain",c8re1U9rCo4
941260,944260,how you can get these objects in our physical world.,c8re1U9rCo4
944260,947260,"Second, we've been able to look at that interaction",c8re1U9rCo4
947260,950260,"of how supermassive black holes interact,",c8re1U9rCo4
950260,954260,"and understand, maybe, the role in which they play",c8re1U9rCo4
954260,957260,"in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.",c8re1U9rCo4
957260,959260,"And last but not least,",c8re1U9rCo4
959260,961260,none of this would have happened,c8re1U9rCo4
961260,964260,without the advent of the tremendous progress,c8re1U9rCo4
964260,966260,that's been made on the technology front.,c8re1U9rCo4
966260,970260,"And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,",c8re1U9rCo4
970260,973260,and holds a lot in store for the future.,c8re1U9rCo4
973260,975260,Thanks very much.,c8re1U9rCo4
975260,980260,(Applause),c8re1U9rCo4
12515,16118,The universe is teeming with planets.,XYNUpQrZISc
16118,17994,"I want us, in the next decade,",XYNUpQrZISc
17994,20387,to build a space telescope that'll be able to image,XYNUpQrZISc
20387,22488,an Earth about another star,XYNUpQrZISc
22488,25232,and figure out whether it can harbor life.,XYNUpQrZISc

Jet Propulsion Laboratory",XYNUpQrZISc
27392,30253,at Princeton and I are working on technology,XYNUpQrZISc
30253,33791,that will be able to do just that in the coming years.,XYNUpQrZISc
33791,35776,Astronomers now believe that every star,XYNUpQrZISc
35776,37716,"in the galaxy has a planet,",XYNUpQrZISc
37716,39992,and they speculate that up to one fifth of them,XYNUpQrZISc

57760,60082,from six billion kilometers away.,XYNUpQrZISc
60082,61650,I want to take that,XYNUpQrZISc
61650,64232,of an Earth-like planet about another star.,XYNUpQrZISc
64232,66632,Why haven't we done that? Why is that hard?,XYNUpQrZISc
66632,68054,"Well to see, let's imagine we take",XYNUpQrZISc
68054,70000,the Hubble Space Telescope,XYNUpQrZISc
70000,71698,and we turn it around and we move it out,XYNUpQrZISc

123823,126143,The light from the star is diffracting.,XYNUpQrZISc
126143,127884,"It's scattering inside the telescope,",XYNUpQrZISc

129388,131140,that washes out the planet.,XYNUpQrZISc
131140,132411,"So to see the planet,",XYNUpQrZISc
132411,134671,we have to do something about all of that light.,XYNUpQrZISc

148482,151642,"the father of the space telescope, in 1962,",XYNUpQrZISc
151642,153758,and he took his inspiration from an eclipse.,XYNUpQrZISc

155941,157981,The moon has moved in front of the sun.,XYNUpQrZISc
157981,159741,It blocks out most of the light,XYNUpQrZISc
159741,162117,so we can see that dim corona around it.,XYNUpQrZISc
162117,163780,It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up,XYNUpQrZISc
163780,166365,"and blocked that spotlight
that's getting right in my eye,",XYNUpQrZISc
166365,168277,I can see you in the back row.,XYNUpQrZISc
168277,169579,"Well, what's going on?",XYNUpQrZISc
169579,171524,Well the moon,XYNUpQrZISc
171524,173939,is casting a shadow down on the Earth.,XYNUpQrZISc
173939,177174,"We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow,",XYNUpQrZISc
177174,178685,"we look back at the sun,",XYNUpQrZISc
178685,180325,and most of the light's been removed,XYNUpQrZISc
180325,182415,"and we can see that dim, fine structure",XYNUpQrZISc
182415,183690,in the corona.,XYNUpQrZISc
183690,186357,Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.,XYNUpQrZISc
186357,189134,"We build a big screen, we fly it in space,",XYNUpQrZISc
189134,191181,"we put it up in front of the star,",XYNUpQrZISc
191181,192965,"we block out most of the light,",XYNUpQrZISc
192965,195981,"we fly a space telescope in
that shadow that's created,",XYNUpQrZISc
195981,197758,"and boom, we get to see planets.",XYNUpQrZISc
197758,200421,Well that would look something like this.,XYNUpQrZISc
200421,202010,"So there's that big screen,",XYNUpQrZISc
202010,202885,"and there's no planets,",XYNUpQrZISc
202885,205389,"because unfortunately it doesn't
actually work very well,",XYNUpQrZISc
205389,208309,because the light waves of the light and waves,XYNUpQrZISc
208309,209989,diffracts around that screen,XYNUpQrZISc
209989,211773,the same way it did in the telescope.,XYNUpQrZISc
211773,214910,"It's like water bending around a rock in a stream,",XYNUpQrZISc
214910,216700,and all that light just destroys the shadow.,XYNUpQrZISc
216700,219373,It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets.,XYNUpQrZISc
219373,221140,But Spitzer actually knew the answer.,XYNUpQrZISc
221140,223645,"If we can feather the edges, soften those edges",XYNUpQrZISc
223645,225411,"so we can control diffraction,",XYNUpQrZISc
225411,227126,"well then we can see a planet,",XYNUpQrZISc
227126,228925,and in the last 10 years or so we've come up,XYNUpQrZISc
228925,230969,with optimal solutions for doing that.,XYNUpQrZISc
230969,234501,It looks something like that.,XYNUpQrZISc
234501,236846,We call that our flower petal starshade.,XYNUpQrZISc
236846,239806,"If we make the edges of those petals exactly right,",XYNUpQrZISc
239806,241230,"if we control their shape,",XYNUpQrZISc
241230,242788,"we can control diffraction,",XYNUpQrZISc
242788,244234,and now we have a great shadow.,XYNUpQrZISc
244234,246878,"It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before,",XYNUpQrZISc
246878,250324,and we can see the planets beam out just like that.,XYNUpQrZISc
250324,252182,"That, of course, has to be bigger than my thumb.",XYNUpQrZISc
252182,253640,That starshade is about,XYNUpQrZISc
253640,255216,the size of half a football field,XYNUpQrZISc
255216,258806,"and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers
away from the telescope",XYNUpQrZISc
258806,260866,"that has to be held right in its shadow,",XYNUpQrZISc
260866,262830,and then we can see those planets.,XYNUpQrZISc
262830,264238,"This sounds formidable,",XYNUpQrZISc
264238,267246,"but brilliant engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL,",XYNUpQrZISc
267246,270126,came up with a fabulous design for how to do that,XYNUpQrZISc
270126,271200,and it looks like this.,XYNUpQrZISc
271200,272988,It starts wrapped around a hub.,XYNUpQrZISc
272988,274967,It separates from the telescope.,XYNUpQrZISc
274967,277238,"The petals unfurl, they open up,",XYNUpQrZISc
277238,278998,the telescope turns around.,XYNUpQrZISc
278998,281142,Then you'll see it flip and fly out,XYNUpQrZISc
281142,284357,"that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope.",XYNUpQrZISc
284357,286827,It's going to move in front of the star,XYNUpQrZISc
286827,290110,"just like that, creates a wonderful shadow.",XYNUpQrZISc
290110,293914,"Boom, we get planets orbiting about it.",XYNUpQrZISc
293914,295638,(Applause),XYNUpQrZISc
295638,297997,Thank you.,XYNUpQrZISc
297997,299950,That's not science fiction.,XYNUpQrZISc
299950,302513,"We've been working on this
for the last five or six years.",XYNUpQrZISc

305116,307555,out in California at Northrop Grumman.,XYNUpQrZISc
307555,309138,So those are four petals.,XYNUpQrZISc
309138,310850,This is a sub-scale star shade.,XYNUpQrZISc
310850,313347,It's about half the size of the one you just saw.,XYNUpQrZISc
313347,314807,You'll see the petals unfurl.,XYNUpQrZISc
314807,316874,Those four petals were built by four undergraduates,XYNUpQrZISc
316874,319289,doing a summer internship at JPL.,XYNUpQrZISc
319289,320535,Now you're seeing it deploy.,XYNUpQrZISc
320535,322517,Those petals have to rotate into place.,XYNUpQrZISc
322517,323687,The base of those petals,XYNUpQrZISc
323687,326060,has to go to the same place every time,XYNUpQrZISc
326060,327683,to within a tenth of a millimeter.,XYNUpQrZISc
327683,329443,"We ran this test 16 times,",XYNUpQrZISc
329443,332282,and 16 times it went into the exact same place,XYNUpQrZISc
332282,333723,to a tenth of a millimeter.,XYNUpQrZISc
333723,335655,"This has to be done very precisely,",XYNUpQrZISc
335655,338163,"but if we can do this, if we can build this technology,",XYNUpQrZISc
338163,339647,"if we can get it into space,",XYNUpQrZISc
339647,341448,you might see something like this.,XYNUpQrZISc
341448,343720,That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars,XYNUpQrZISc
343720,346314,taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.,XYNUpQrZISc
346314,348698,"If we can take a similar space telescope,",XYNUpQrZISc

354954,357890,"that's a family portrait of our
solar system -- but not ours.",XYNUpQrZISc
357890,360412,We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system,XYNUpQrZISc
360412,362044,"as seen through an occulter,",XYNUpQrZISc
362044,363114,through a starshade like that.,XYNUpQrZISc

367762,369102,next to the residual light,XYNUpQrZISc
369102,371007,is that pale blue dot. That's Earth.,XYNUpQrZISc

373381,374786,"oxygen, ozone,",XYNUpQrZISc
374786,377309,the things that might tell us that it could harbor life.,XYNUpQrZISc
377309,379718,I think this is the coolest possible science.,XYNUpQrZISc
379718,381371,"That's why I got into doing this,",XYNUpQrZISc
381371,383341,because I think that will change the world.,XYNUpQrZISc

19036,20485,A beard full of bees.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
20485,23728,"Now, this is what many of you might picture",R2kOgSVF2Uk
23728,26701,"when you think about honeybees, maybe insects,",R2kOgSVF2Uk

29789,32447,"And let me start by telling you, I gotcha.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
32447,36928,"I understand that. But, there are many things to know,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
36928,39608,"and I want you to open your minds here,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
39608,43098,"keep them open, and change your perspective about honeybees.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
43098,46063,Notice that this man is not getting stung.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
46063,49507,"He probably has a queen bee tied to his chin,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
49507,51626,and the other bees are attracted to it.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
51626,55662,"So this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
55662,59430,and that goes deep back for thousands of years.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
59430,62592,"We're very co-evolved, because we depend on bees",R2kOgSVF2Uk
62592,65552,"for pollination and, even more recently,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
65552,67376,as an economic commodity.,R2kOgSVF2Uk

70176,72753,"not just dying, but they're gone.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
72753,74555,We don't even find dead bodies.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
74555,76926,"This is called colony collapse disorder,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
76926,79138,and it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe,R2kOgSVF2Uk
79138,81584,"still do not know what's causing it,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
81584,84154,"but what we do know is that, with the declining numbers",R2kOgSVF2Uk
84154,88391,"of bees, the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops",R2kOgSVF2Uk
88391,93398,that we rely on for food is going up in price.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
93398,97156,So honeybees are important for their role in the economy,R2kOgSVF2Uk
97156,99181,as well as in agriculture.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
99181,101000,Here you can see some pictures of what are called,R2kOgSVF2Uk
101000,103689,"green roofs, or urban agriculture.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
103689,105967,We're familiar with the image on the left that shows,R2kOgSVF2Uk
105967,108751,a local neighborhood garden in the South End.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
108751,111542,That's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
111542,113961,"And perhaps a green roof in the future,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
113961,115892,"when we're further utilizing urban areas,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
115892,119350,where there are stacks of garden spaces.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
119350,122703,Check out this image above the orange line in Boston.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
122703,126180,Try to spot the beehive. It's there.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
126180,128877,"It's on the rooftop, right on the corner there,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
128877,131270,and it's been there for a couple of years now.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
131270,134522,The way that urban beekeeping currently operates,R2kOgSVF2Uk
134522,137113,"is that the beehives are quite hidden,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
137113,139140,and it's not because they need to be.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
139140,142117,"It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
142117,145791,"and that's why I want you today to try to think about this,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
145791,148074,think about the benefits of bees in cities,R2kOgSVF2Uk
148074,150333,and why they really are a terrific thing.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
150333,153303,Let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
153303,155886,"So we know flowers, we know fruits and vegetables,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
155886,159092,even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock,R2kOgSVF2Uk
159092,161555,"for the meats that we eat, rely on pollinators,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
161555,164988,"but you've got male and female parts to a plant here,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
164988,167878,and basically pollinators are attracted to plants,R2kOgSVF2Uk
167878,170905,"for their nectar, and in the process,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
170905,174280,"a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
174280,177712,"or that male kind of sperm counterpart, along the way,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
177712,180330,"and then travel to different flowers, and eventually",R2kOgSVF2Uk
180330,183449,"an apple, in this case, will be produced.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
183449,185716,You can see the orientation. The stem is down.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
185716,188670,"The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
188670,191528,but that's a basic overview of how pollination works.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
191528,194400,"And let's think about urban living, not today,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
194400,197265,"and not in the past, but what about in a hundred years?",R2kOgSVF2Uk
197265,201203,What's it gonna look like? We have huge grand challenges,R2kOgSVF2Uk
201203,205133,"these days of habitat loss. We have more and more people,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
205133,208494,"billions of people, in 100 years, God knows how many people,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
208494,211858,"and how little space there will be to fit all of them,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
211858,215280,"so we need to change the way that we see cities, and",R2kOgSVF2Uk
215280,218643,"looking at this picture on the left of New York City today,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
218643,220510,you can see how gray and brown it is.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
220510,224041,We have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back,R2kOgSVF2Uk
224041,226077,"into the atmosphere,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
226077,228412,"contributing to global climate change, no doubt.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
228412,230912,"What about in 100 years, if we have green rooftops",R2kOgSVF2Uk
230912,234075,"everywhere, and gardening, and we create our own crops",R2kOgSVF2Uk
234075,237878,"right in the cities? We save on the costs of transportation,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
237878,241974,"we save on a healthier diet, and we also educate",R2kOgSVF2Uk
241974,243676,and create new jobs locally.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
243676,248342,We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
248342,251726,Here's some data that we collected through our company,R2kOgSVF2Uk
251726,254628,"with Best Bees, where we deliver, install and manage",R2kOgSVF2Uk
254628,256871,"honeybee hives for anybody who wants them,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
256871,260388,"in the city, in the countryside, and we introduce honeybees,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
260388,263247,and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop,R2kOgSVF2Uk
263247,265728,"or fire escape, for even that matter,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
265728,268502,and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
268502,270634,There's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed,R2kOgSVF2Uk
270634,274077,"in these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
274077,275477,overwintering survival.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
275477,278302,"Now this has been a huge problem for many years,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
278302,282362,"basically since the late 1980s, when the varroa mite came",R2kOgSVF2Uk
282362,285738,"and brought many different viruses, bacteria",R2kOgSVF2Uk
285738,287542,and fungal diseases with it.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
287542,289291,"Overwintering success is hard,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
289291,291584,"and that's when most of the colonies are lost,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
291584,294250,"and we found that in the cities, bees are surviving",R2kOgSVF2Uk
294250,296598,better than they are in the country.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
296598,298826,"A bit counterintuitive, right?",R2kOgSVF2Uk
298826,300908,"We think, oh, bees, countryside, agriculture,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
300908,303135,but that's not what the bees are showing.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
303135,305284,The bees like it in the city. (Laughter),R2kOgSVF2Uk
305284,308431,"Furthermore, they also produce more honey.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
308431,311000,The urban honey is delicious.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
311000,314097,"The bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
314097,316569,where we have hundreds of thousands of bees,R2kOgSVF2Uk
316569,318072,flying overheard right now,R2kOgSVF2Uk
318072,320377,"that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
320377,322687,are going to all of the local community gardens,R2kOgSVF2Uk
322687,325086,"and making delicious, healthy honey",R2kOgSVF2Uk
325086,328114,that just tastes like the flowers in our city.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
328114,332901,"So the yield for urban hives, in terms of honey production,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
332901,336016,"is higher as well as the overwintering survival,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
336016,337390,compared to rural areas.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
337390,339392,"Again, a bit counterintuitive.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
339392,342713,And looking back historically at the timeline,R2kOgSVF2Uk
342713,346989,"of honeybee health, we can go back to the year 950 and see",R2kOgSVF2Uk
346989,350037,that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
350037,353188,So the problems of bees today isn't necessarily,R2kOgSVF2Uk
353188,355813,something new. It has been happening,R2kOgSVF2Uk
355813,357880,"since over a thousand years ago,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
357880,361577,but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
361577,363605,So one thing I want to encourage you to think about,R2kOgSVF2Uk
363605,366007,is the idea of what an urban island is.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
366007,369403,You think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
369403,370982,Why are bees doing better in the city?,R2kOgSVF2Uk

318421,319860,I will die.,vwTDeT4v7RM

335212,337045,it's probably the same comfort,vwTDeT4v7RM
337045,338692,rating we've found in other,vwTDeT4v7RM

340188,341899,as non-comfortable.,vwTDeT4v7RM
341899,344043,So we sat together with a team,vwTDeT4v7RM
344043,346373,"which prepared the Bid Book, or goal,",vwTDeT4v7RM
346373,349148,"that we said, let's aim",vwTDeT4v7RM

351107,353750,"for outdoor comfort in this range,",vwTDeT4v7RM
353750,355421,which is perceived with a,vwTDeT4v7RM

358624,360245,"Celsius perceived temperature,",vwTDeT4v7RM
360245,362405,which is extremely comfortable.,vwTDeT4v7RM
362405,364998,People would feel really fine,vwTDeT4v7RM
364998,366892,in an open outdoor environment.,vwTDeT4v7RM
366892,368851,But what does it mean?,vwTDeT4v7RM
368851,370900,"If we just look on what happens,",vwTDeT4v7RM
370900,373011,"we see, temperature's too high.",vwTDeT4v7RM

377268,379371,we won't get much better.,vwTDeT4v7RM
379371,382092,So we need to do something active.,vwTDeT4v7RM
382092,383962,"We need, for instance, to bring",vwTDeT4v7RM
383962,386058,"in radiant cooling technology,",vwTDeT4v7RM
386058,387947,and we need to combine this,vwTDeT4v7RM
387947,390164,with so-called soft conditioning.,vwTDeT4v7RM
390164,391600,And how does it look like in a stadium?,vwTDeT4v7RM
391600,393928,So the stadium has a few,vwTDeT4v7RM
393928,395673,elements which create that,vwTDeT4v7RM
395673,396915,"outdoor comfort. First of all,",vwTDeT4v7RM
396915,399151,it's shading. It needs,vwTDeT4v7RM
399151,401465,to protect where the people,vwTDeT4v7RM
401465,403129,are sitting against strong,vwTDeT4v7RM
403129,404328,and warm wind.,vwTDeT4v7RM
404328,405967,But that's not all what we need,vwTDeT4v7RM
405967,408978,to do. We need to use,vwTDeT4v7RM
408978,411147,active systems.,vwTDeT4v7RM
411147,413587,Instead of blowing a hurricane,vwTDeT4v7RM
413587,415962,"of chilled air through the stadium,",vwTDeT4v7RM
415962,417710,we can use radiant,vwTDeT4v7RM
417710,419744,"cooling technologies, like a",vwTDeT4v7RM
419744,421944,floor heating system where water,vwTDeT4v7RM
421944,424327,pipes are embedded in the floor.,vwTDeT4v7RM
424327,426145,And just by using cold water,vwTDeT4v7RM
426145,427473,"going through the water pipes,",vwTDeT4v7RM
427473,429129,you can release the heat,vwTDeT4v7RM
429129,431209,which is absorbed during the day,vwTDeT4v7RM
431209,432446,"in the stadium, so you can",vwTDeT4v7RM
432446,434329,"create that comfort, and then by",vwTDeT4v7RM
434329,436889,adding dry air instead of,vwTDeT4v7RM
436889,439121,"down-chilled air, the spectators",vwTDeT4v7RM
439121,441003,and the football players can,vwTDeT4v7RM
441003,443336,adjust to their individual,vwTDeT4v7RM
443336,445113,"comfort needs, to their",vwTDeT4v7RM
445113,446769,individual energy balance.,vwTDeT4v7RM
446769,448746,They can adjust and find,vwTDeT4v7RM
448746,451121,their comfort they need to find.,vwTDeT4v7RM
451121,455577,There are 12 stadia probably,vwTDeT4v7RM
455577,457537,"to come, but there are",vwTDeT4v7RM
457537,459856,32 training pitches where,vwTDeT4v7RM
459856,461553,all the individual countries,vwTDeT4v7RM
461553,462737,are going to train.,vwTDeT4v7RM
462737,464634,We applied the same concept:,vwTDeT4v7RM
464634,466864,"shading of the training pitch,",vwTDeT4v7RM
466864,469704,"using a shelter against wind,",vwTDeT4v7RM
469704,471593,then using the grass.,vwTDeT4v7RM
471593,474113,Natural-watered lawn is a,vwTDeT4v7RM

475592,476809,"stabilizing temperature,",vwTDeT4v7RM

478745,479824,create comfort.,vwTDeT4v7RM
479824,483698,But even the best passive design,vwTDeT4v7RM
483698,484444,wouldn't help.,vwTDeT4v7RM
484444,485454,We need active system.,vwTDeT4v7RM
485454,486504,And how do we do that?,vwTDeT4v7RM
486504,488872,Our idea for the bid was,vwTDeT4v7RM
488872,490609,"100 percent solar cooling,",vwTDeT4v7RM

12509,16841,I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on,PB2OegI6wvI
16841,20404,involving a man named Steve Titus.,PB2OegI6wvI
20404,23433,Titus was a restaurant manager.,PB2OegI6wvI
23433,27523,"He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,",PB2OegI6wvI
27523,29418,"he was engaged to Gretchen,",PB2OegI6wvI
29418,32366,"about to be married, she was the love of his life.",PB2OegI6wvI
32366,34650,"And one night, the couple went out",PB2OegI6wvI
34650,37655,for a romantic restaurant meal.,PB2OegI6wvI
37655,39303,"They were on their way home,",PB2OegI6wvI
39303,42253,and they were pulled over by a police officer.,PB2OegI6wvI
42253,45570,"You see, Titus' car sort of resembled",PB2OegI6wvI
45570,49457,a car that was driven earlier in the evening,PB2OegI6wvI
49457,52863,"by a man who raped a female hitchhiker,",PB2OegI6wvI
52863,56457,and Titus kind of resembled that rapist.,PB2OegI6wvI
56457,59035,"So the police took a picture of Titus,",PB2OegI6wvI
59035,61802,"they put it in a photo lineup,",PB2OegI6wvI
61802,63962,"they later showed it to the victim,",PB2OegI6wvI
63962,66122,and she pointed to Titus' photo.,PB2OegI6wvI
66122,69743,"She said, That one's the closest.""""",PB2OegI6wvI
69743,73631,"The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,",PB2OegI6wvI
73631,76972,"and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,",PB2OegI6wvI
76972,79068,the rape victim got on the stand,PB2OegI6wvI
79068,83410,"and said, I'm absolutely positive that's the man.""""",PB2OegI6wvI
83410,86336,And Titus was convicted.,PB2OegI6wvI
86336,88310,"He proclaimed his innocence,",PB2OegI6wvI
88310,90892,"his family screamed at the jury,",PB2OegI6wvI
90892,93763,"his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,",PB2OegI6wvI
93763,97158,and Titus is taken away to jail.,PB2OegI6wvI
97158,100616,So what would you do at this point?,PB2OegI6wvI
100616,102252,What would you do?,PB2OegI6wvI
102252,106020,"Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,",PB2OegI6wvI
106020,108052,and yet he got an idea.,PB2OegI6wvI
108052,110483,"He called up the local newspaper,",PB2OegI6wvI
110483,113870,"he got the interest of an investigative journalist,",PB2OegI6wvI
113870,118606,"and that journalist actually found the real rapist,",PB2OegI6wvI
118606,121959,"a man who ultimately confessed to this rape,",PB2OegI6wvI
121959,125251,a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes,PB2OegI6wvI
125251,126583,"in that area,",PB2OegI6wvI
126583,129757,"and when this information was given to the judge,",PB2OegI6wvI
129757,132693,the judge set Titus free.,PB2OegI6wvI
132693,136724,"And really, that's where this case should have ended.",PB2OegI6wvI
136724,137847,It should have been over.,PB2OegI6wvI
137847,140367,"Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year,",PB2OegI6wvI
140367,144203,"a year of accusation and trial, but over.",PB2OegI6wvI
144203,146250,It didn't end that way.,PB2OegI6wvI
146250,148928,Titus was so bitter.,PB2OegI6wvI
148928,151508,He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.,PB2OegI6wvI
151508,153351,He lost his fiancée.,PB2OegI6wvI
153351,156257,She couldn't put up with his persistent anger.,PB2OegI6wvI
156257,158403,"He lost his entire savings,",PB2OegI6wvI
158403,161261,and so he decided to file a lawsuit,PB2OegI6wvI
161261,163542,against the police and others whom he felt,PB2OegI6wvI
163542,165861,were responsible for his suffering.,PB2OegI6wvI
165861,170574,"And that's when I really started working on this case,",PB2OegI6wvI
170574,172535,trying to figure out,PB2OegI6wvI
172535,174609,how did that victim go from,PB2OegI6wvI
174609,176137,"That one's the closest""""",PB2OegI6wvI
176137,180887,"to I'm absolutely positive that's the guy.""""",PB2OegI6wvI
180887,184166,"Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case.",PB2OegI6wvI
184166,187200,"He spent every waking moment thinking about it,",PB2OegI6wvI
187200,191351,"and just days before he was to have his day in court,",PB2OegI6wvI
191351,193570,"he woke up in the morning,",PB2OegI6wvI
193570,195378,"doubled over in pain,",PB2OegI6wvI
195378,198072,and died of a stress-related heart attack.,PB2OegI6wvI
198072,201259,He was 35 years old.,PB2OegI6wvI
201259,206069,So I was asked to work on Titus' case,PB2OegI6wvI
206069,208584,because I'm a psychological scientist.,PB2OegI6wvI
208584,212411,I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.,PB2OegI6wvI

302598,304839,many people believe that memory,PB2OegI6wvI

327613,332726,"You can go in there and change it, but so can other people.",PB2OegI6wvI
332726,337975,I first started studying this constructive memory process,PB2OegI6wvI
337975,340390,in the 1970s.,PB2OegI6wvI
340390,344813,I did my experiments that involved showing people,PB2OegI6wvI

478259,480560,And so what these studies are showing,PB2OegI6wvI
480560,484420,is that when you feed people misinformation,PB2OegI6wvI
484420,487800,"about some experience that they may have had,",PB2OegI6wvI
487800,493455,you can distort or contaminate or change their memory.,PB2OegI6wvI
493455,495655,"Well out there in the real world,",PB2OegI6wvI
495655,498546,misinformation is everywhere.,PB2OegI6wvI
498546,499906,We get misinformation,PB2OegI6wvI
499906,502822,"not only if we're questioned in a leading way,",PB2OegI6wvI
502822,505269,but if we talk to other witnesses,PB2OegI6wvI
505269,508302,who might consciously or inadvertently feed us,PB2OegI6wvI
508302,510439,"some erroneous information,",PB2OegI6wvI
510439,515169,"or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,",PB2OegI6wvI
515169,517962,all of these provide the opportunity,PB2OegI6wvI
517962,522312,for this kind of contamination of our memory.,PB2OegI6wvI
522312,526100,"In the 1990s, we began to see",PB2OegI6wvI
526100,530783,an even more extreme kind of memory problem.,PB2OegI6wvI
530783,533879,Some patients were going into therapy with one problem --,PB2OegI6wvI
533879,536793,"maybe they had depression, an eating disorder --",PB2OegI6wvI
536793,539546,and they were coming out of therapy,PB2OegI6wvI
539546,542207,with a different problem.,PB2OegI6wvI
542207,545908,"Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations,",PB2OegI6wvI
545908,547891,"sometimes in satanic rituals,",PB2OegI6wvI
547891,552588,sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.,PB2OegI6wvI
552588,555142,One woman came out of psychotherapy,PB2OegI6wvI
555142,557570,believing that she'd endured years,PB2OegI6wvI
557570,561472,"of ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy",PB2OegI6wvI
561472,564038,and that the baby was cut from her belly.,PB2OegI6wvI
564038,566397,But there were no physical scars,PB2OegI6wvI
566397,568423,or any kind of physical evidence,PB2OegI6wvI
568423,571304,that could have supported her story.,PB2OegI6wvI
571304,574312,"And when I began looking into these cases,",PB2OegI6wvI
574312,575762,"I was wondering,",PB2OegI6wvI
575762,578090,where do these bizarre memories come from?,PB2OegI6wvI
578090,582477,And what I found is that most of these situations,PB2OegI6wvI
582477,587968,involved some particular form of psychotherapy.,PB2OegI6wvI
587968,589567,"And so I asked,",PB2OegI6wvI
589567,592955,were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy --,PB2OegI6wvI
592955,595839,like the imagination exercises,PB2OegI6wvI
595839,597896,"or dream interpretation,",PB2OegI6wvI
597896,600028,"or in some cases hypnosis,",PB2OegI6wvI
600028,603846,or in some cases exposure to false information --,PB2OegI6wvI
603846,606633,were these leading these patients,PB2OegI6wvI
606633,609310,"to develop these very bizarre,",PB2OegI6wvI
609310,612241,unlikely memories?,PB2OegI6wvI
612241,614400,And I designed some experiments,PB2OegI6wvI
614400,619425,to try to study the processes that were being used,PB2OegI6wvI
619425,622498,in this psychotherapy so I could study,PB2OegI6wvI
622498,626049,the development of these very rich false memories.,PB2OegI6wvI
626049,628457,"In one of the first studies we did,",PB2OegI6wvI
628457,630810,"we used suggestion,",PB2OegI6wvI
630810,634873,"a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,",PB2OegI6wvI
634873,636983,we used this kind of suggestion,PB2OegI6wvI
636983,638835,and planted a false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
638835,641912,"that when you were a kid, five or six years old,",PB2OegI6wvI
641912,644163,you were lost in a shopping mall.,PB2OegI6wvI
644163,646663,You were frightened. You were crying.,PB2OegI6wvI
646663,649177,You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person,PB2OegI6wvI
649177,651029,and reunited with the family.,PB2OegI6wvI
651029,653637,And we succeeded in planting this memory,PB2OegI6wvI
653637,657743,in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.,PB2OegI6wvI
657743,659748,"And you might be thinking, well,",PB2OegI6wvI
659748,662094,that's not particularly stressful.,PB2OegI6wvI
662094,665463,But we and other investigators have planted,PB2OegI6wvI
665463,668221,rich false memories of things that were,PB2OegI6wvI
668221,671136,much more unusual and much more stressful.,PB2OegI6wvI
671136,673675,"So in a study done in Tennessee,",PB2OegI6wvI
673675,676091,researchers planted the false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
676091,678665,"that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned",PB2OegI6wvI
678665,681172,and had to be rescued by a life guard.,PB2OegI6wvI
681172,683475,"And in a study done in Canada,",PB2OegI6wvI
683475,685999,researchers planted the false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
685999,687227,"that when you were a kid,",PB2OegI6wvI
687227,690957,something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal,PB2OegI6wvI
690957,692339,"happened to you,",PB2OegI6wvI
692339,695761,succeeding with about half of their subjects.,PB2OegI6wvI
695761,698113,"And in a study done in Italy,",PB2OegI6wvI
698113,700771,"researchers planted the false memory,",PB2OegI6wvI
700771,705983,"when you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.",PB2OegI6wvI
705983,708190,I do want to add that it might seem,PB2OegI6wvI
708190,711929,like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects,PB2OegI6wvI
711929,713529,"in the name of science,",PB2OegI6wvI
713529,718167,but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation,PB2OegI6wvI
718167,720142,by research ethics boards,PB2OegI6wvI
720142,722484,that have made the decision,PB2OegI6wvI
722484,725557,that the temporary discomfort that some,PB2OegI6wvI
725557,728641,of these subjects might experience in these studies,PB2OegI6wvI
728641,732541,is outweighed by the importance of this problem,PB2OegI6wvI
732541,735648,for understanding memory processes,PB2OegI6wvI
735648,738994,and the abuse of memory that is going on,PB2OegI6wvI
738994,742287,in some places in the world.,PB2OegI6wvI
742287,745325,"Well, to my surprise,",PB2OegI6wvI
745325,748754,when I published this work and began to speak out,PB2OegI6wvI
748754,752649,"against this particular brand of psychotherapy,",PB2OegI6wvI
752649,756629,it created some pretty bad problems for me:,PB2OegI6wvI
756629,761530,"hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,",PB2OegI6wvI
761530,763206,"who felt under attack,",PB2OegI6wvI
763206,766734,and by the patients whom they had influenced.,PB2OegI6wvI
766734,769671,I had sometimes armed guards at speeches,PB2OegI6wvI
769671,771576,"that I was invited to give,",PB2OegI6wvI
771576,775793,people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.,PB2OegI6wvI
775793,777774,But probably the worst,PB2OegI6wvI
777774,780541,was I suspected that a woman,PB2OegI6wvI
780541,782965,was innocent of abuse,PB2OegI6wvI
782965,785801,that was being claimed by her grown daughter.,PB2OegI6wvI
785801,789218,She accused her mother of sexual abuse,PB2OegI6wvI
789218,791077,based on a repressed memory.,PB2OegI6wvI
791077,793960,And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story,PB2OegI6wvI
793960,797394,to be filmed and presented in public places.,PB2OegI6wvI
797394,799903,"I was suspicious of this story,",PB2OegI6wvI
799903,802203,"and so I started to investigate,",PB2OegI6wvI
802203,806686,and eventually found information that convinced me,PB2OegI6wvI
806686,808975,that this mother was innocent.,PB2OegI6wvI
808975,811936,"I published an exposé on the case,",PB2OegI6wvI
811936,815380,"and a little while later, the accusing daughter",PB2OegI6wvI
815380,816901,filed a lawsuit.,PB2OegI6wvI
816901,819256,"Even though I'd never mentioned her name,",PB2OegI6wvI
819256,823618,she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.,PB2OegI6wvI
823618,826341,And I went through nearly five years,PB2OegI6wvI
826341,832893,"of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,",PB2OegI6wvI
832893,836567,"but finally, finally, it was over and I could really",PB2OegI6wvI
836567,838991,get back to my work.,PB2OegI6wvI
838991,841476,"In the process, however, I became part",PB2OegI6wvI
841476,844130,of a disturbing trend in America,PB2OegI6wvI
844130,846237,where scientists are being sued,PB2OegI6wvI
846237,850836,for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.,PB2OegI6wvI
850836,854194,"When I got back to my work, I asked this question:",PB2OegI6wvI
854194,856592,"if I plant a false memory in your mind,",PB2OegI6wvI
856592,858436,does it have repercussions?,PB2OegI6wvI
858436,860395,"Does it affect your later thoughts,",PB2OegI6wvI
860395,862496,your later behaviors?,PB2OegI6wvI
862496,864523,Our first study planted a false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
864523,867849,that you got sick as a child eating certain foods:,PB2OegI6wvI
867849,870848,"hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.",PB2OegI6wvI
870848,874038,"And we found that once we planted this false memory,",PB2OegI6wvI
874038,876489,people didn't want to eat the foods as much,PB2OegI6wvI
876489,878749,at an outdoor picnic.,PB2OegI6wvI
878749,882622,The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.,PB2OegI6wvI
882622,884980,"If we planted a warm, fuzzy memory",PB2OegI6wvI
884980,888001,"involving a healthy food like asparagus,",PB2OegI6wvI
888001,891476,we could get people to want to eat asparagus more.,PB2OegI6wvI
891476,893850,And so what these studies are showing,PB2OegI6wvI
893850,895965,is that you can plant false memories,PB2OegI6wvI
895965,897378,and they have repercussions,PB2OegI6wvI
897378,902463,that affect behavior long after the memories take hold.,PB2OegI6wvI
902463,904887,"Well, along with this ability",PB2OegI6wvI
904887,907810,to plant memories and control behavior,PB2OegI6wvI
907810,911991,"obviously come some important ethical issues,",PB2OegI6wvI
911991,915050,"like, when should we use this mind technology?",PB2OegI6wvI
915050,918730,And should we ever ban its use?,PB2OegI6wvI
918730,921513,Therapists can't ethically plant false memories,PB2OegI6wvI
921513,923100,in the mind of their patients,PB2OegI6wvI
923100,925664,"even if it would help the patient,",PB2OegI6wvI
925664,927286,but there's nothing to stop a parent,PB2OegI6wvI
927286,931735,from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.,PB2OegI6wvI
931735,934340,"And when I suggested this publicly,",PB2OegI6wvI
934340,937686,it created an outcry again.,PB2OegI6wvI

941719,943964,"Hello, Santa Claus. (Laughter)",PB2OegI6wvI

955494,958523,"a kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan,",PB2OegI6wvI
958523,960055,"all the things that go with it,",PB2OegI6wvI
960055,963071,or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?,PB2OegI6wvI
963071,966462,I know what I would choose for a kid of mine.,PB2OegI6wvI
966462,970439,But maybe my work has made me different from most people.,PB2OegI6wvI
970439,972518,"Most people cherish their memories,",PB2OegI6wvI
972518,974672,"know that they represent their identity,",PB2OegI6wvI
974672,976697,"who they are, where they came from.",PB2OegI6wvI
976697,979555,And I appreciate that. I feel that way too.,PB2OegI6wvI
979555,981760,But I know from my work,PB2OegI6wvI
981760,986241,how much fiction is already in there.,PB2OegI6wvI
986241,988973,If I've learned anything from these decades,PB2OegI6wvI
988973,991383,"of working on these problems, it's this:",PB2OegI6wvI

1000608,1003810,it doesn't mean that it really happened.,PB2OegI6wvI
1003810,1007675,We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.,PB2OegI6wvI
1007675,1011223,We need independent corroboration.,PB2OegI6wvI
1011223,1014313,Such a discovery has made me more tolerant,PB2OegI6wvI
1014313,1016452,of the everyday memory mistakes,PB2OegI6wvI

235160,240160,but they took technology and maybe made it into things,QGn8F4j6pH8
240160,243160,"that people would use in a new way,",QGn8F4j6pH8
243160,244160,and maybe finding some new functionality.,QGn8F4j6pH8
244160,248160,"This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company,",QGn8F4j6pH8
248160,249160,"right when it launched,",QGn8F4j6pH8
249160,252160,and it's the first watch that has a display,QGn8F4j6pH8
252160,254160,that switches from horizontal to vertical.,QGn8F4j6pH8
254160,259160,"And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,",QGn8F4j6pH8
259160,260160,without bending my elbow.,QGn8F4j6pH8
260160,263160,"And other projects, which were really about transformation,",QGn8F4j6pH8
264160,267160,about matching the human need.,QGn8F4j6pH8
267160,270160,"This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,",QGn8F4j6pH8
270160,272160,"and it ships completely flat,",QGn8F4j6pH8
272160,276160,and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.,QGn8F4j6pH8
277160,278160,And something a little bit more experimental:,QGn8F4j6pH8
278160,281160,"this is a light fixture for Swarovski,",QGn8F4j6pH8
282160,284160,"and what it does is, it changes shape.",QGn8F4j6pH8
284160,288160,"So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.",QGn8F4j6pH8
288160,291160,"And just by drawing on a little computer tablet,",QGn8F4j6pH8
291160,295160,the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.,QGn8F4j6pH8
296160,298160,"And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.",QGn8F4j6pH8
298160,300160,This is a pretty involved process;,QGn8F4j6pH8
300160,302160,it took us about four and a half years.,QGn8F4j6pH8
302160,306160,"But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,",QGn8F4j6pH8
307160,308160,a new experience of light.,QGn8F4j6pH8
308160,313160,"So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.",QGn8F4j6pH8
313160,317160,"And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.",QGn8F4j6pH8
317160,319160,And the new experience I was looking for,QGn8F4j6pH8
319160,322160,is giving the choice for the user to go from,QGn8F4j6pH8
322160,325160,"a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,",QGn8F4j6pH8
325160,328160,all the way to a bright work light.,QGn8F4j6pH8
328160,330160,"So, the light bulb actually does that.",QGn8F4j6pH8
331160,333160,"It allows the person to switch,",QGn8F4j6pH8
333160,335160,and to mix these two colorations.,QGn8F4j6pH8
335160,338160,And it's done in a very simple way:,QGn8F4j6pH8
338160,340160,"one just touches the base of the light,",QGn8F4j6pH8
341160,343160,"and on one side, you can mix the brightness,",QGn8F4j6pH8
343160,346160,"and on the other, the coloration of the light.",QGn8F4j6pH8
346160,351160,"So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them,",QGn8F4j6pH8
351160,353160,and I think as designers we need to really think,QGn8F4j6pH8
353160,357160,about how we can create a different relationship,QGn8F4j6pH8
357160,359160,"between our work and the world,",QGn8F4j6pH8
360160,361160,"whether it's for business,",QGn8F4j6pH8
361160,366160,"or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.",QGn8F4j6pH8
366160,371160,Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring,QGn8F4j6pH8
371160,376160,"value to business, value to the users also,",QGn8F4j6pH8
376160,380160,but I think it's the values that we put into these projects,QGn8F4j6pH8
380160,383160,that ultimately create the greater value.,QGn8F4j6pH8
384160,385160,And the values we bring,QGn8F4j6pH8
385160,389160,"can be about environmental issues,",QGn8F4j6pH8
389160,392160,"about sustainability, about lower power consumption.",QGn8F4j6pH8
392160,396160,"You know, they can be about function and beauty;",QGn8F4j6pH8
396160,397160,they can be about business strategy.,QGn8F4j6pH8
397160,399160,But designers are really the glue,QGn8F4j6pH8
400160,402160,that brings these things together.,QGn8F4j6pH8
402160,407160,"So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with,",QGn8F4j6pH8
408160,411160,and it has a humanistic technology.,QGn8F4j6pH8
411160,414160,"It feels your skin. It rests on your skin,",QGn8F4j6pH8
414160,415160,and it knows when it is you're talking.,QGn8F4j6pH8
415160,417160,"And by knowing when it is you're talking,",QGn8F4j6pH8
418160,420160,"it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,",QGn8F4j6pH8
420160,423160,which is the environmental noises.,QGn8F4j6pH8
423160,425160,But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone,QGn8F4j6pH8
425160,430160,"is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,",QGn8F4j6pH8
431160,433160,"and all the nerdy stuff out of it,",QGn8F4j6pH8
433160,435160,and try to make it as beautiful as we can.,QGn8F4j6pH8
435160,436160,"I mean, think about it:",QGn8F4j6pH8
436160,441160,"the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,",QGn8F4j6pH8
443160,447160,"or accessories is really important,",QGn8F4j6pH8
447160,450160,"so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.",QGn8F4j6pH8
451160,454160,And this is what we're pursuing here.,QGn8F4j6pH8
454160,457160,But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.,QGn8F4j6pH8
458160,460160,"I want to point at something here, on the left.",QGn8F4j6pH8
460160,464160,"This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside",QGn8F4j6pH8
464160,466160,that makes this technology work.,QGn8F4j6pH8
466160,468160,But this is the design process:,QGn8F4j6pH8
468160,469160,"there's somebody changing the board,",QGn8F4j6pH8
469160,473160,"putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,",QGn8F4j6pH8
473160,476160,as the designers on the other side are doing the work.,QGn8F4j6pH8
476160,480160,"So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.",QGn8F4j6pH8
480160,482160,It's really about designing from the inside out.,QGn8F4j6pH8
482160,484160,"And then, on the other side of the room,",QGn8F4j6pH8
485160,486160,"the designers are making small adjustments,",QGn8F4j6pH8
486160,491160,"sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.",QGn8F4j6pH8
491160,495160,And it's what I call being design driven.,QGn8F4j6pH8
495160,496160,"You know, there is some push and pull,",QGn8F4j6pH8
497160,499160,but design is really helping define,QGn8F4j6pH8
499160,502160,the whole experience from the inside out.,QGn8F4j6pH8
503160,505160,"And then, of course, design is never done.",QGn8F4j6pH8
505160,509160,And this is -- the other new way that is unique,QGn8F4j6pH8
509160,511160,"in how we work is, because it's never done,",QGn8F4j6pH8
511160,513160,you have to do all this other stuff.,QGn8F4j6pH8
513160,516160,"The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue",QGn8F4j6pH8
516160,519160,"to really touch the user, in many ways.",QGn8F4j6pH8
520160,524160,"But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?",QGn8F4j6pH8
524160,530160,"And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,",QGn8F4j6pH8
531160,534160,"you know, really understands that you need a different structure.",QGn8F4j6pH8
534160,537160,"So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,",QGn8F4j6pH8
538160,543160,it's a partnership. We can continue to work,QGn8F4j6pH8
543160,545160,"and dedicate ourselves to this project,",QGn8F4j6pH8
546160,548160,and then we also share in the rewards.,QGn8F4j6pH8
548160,553160,"And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.",QGn8F4j6pH8
553160,555160,"This is called Y Water,",QGn8F4j6pH8
555160,558160,"and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,",QGn8F4j6pH8
559160,561160,"Austrian originally, who came to us,",QGn8F4j6pH8
561160,565160,"and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,",QGn8F4j6pH8
565160,568160,"or an organic drink for his kids,",QGn8F4j6pH8
568160,571160,to replace the high-sugar-content sodas,QGn8F4j6pH8
572160,574160,that he's trying to get them away from.,QGn8F4j6pH8
574160,576160,"So, we worked on this bottle,",QGn8F4j6pH8
577160,579160,and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.,QGn8F4j6pH8
579160,585160,And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.,QGn8F4j6pH8
586160,587160,"The bottles connect together,",QGn8F4j6pH8
587160,591160,"and you can create different shapes, different forms.",QGn8F4j6pH8
591160,592160,(Laughter),QGn8F4j6pH8
592160,594160,(Applause),QGn8F4j6pH8
594160,595160,Thank you.,QGn8F4j6pH8
595160,596160,(Applause),QGn8F4j6pH8
597160,598160,"And then while we were doing this,",QGn8F4j6pH8
598160,602160,"the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,",QGn8F4j6pH8
602160,607160,"and then we thought, well these words, why"" and ""why not,""""",QGn8F4j6pH8
607160,609160,are probably the most important words that kids ask.,QGn8F4j6pH8
610160,613160,So we called it Y Water. And so this is,QGn8F4j6pH8
613160,616160,another place where it all comes together in the same room:,QGn8F4j6pH8
616160,622160,"the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,",QGn8F4j6pH8
622160,624160,it all becomes deeply connected.,QGn8F4j6pH8
625160,627160,"And then the other thing about this project is,",QGn8F4j6pH8
627160,631160,"we bring intellectual property,",QGn8F4j6pH8
631160,633160,"we bring a marketing approach,",QGn8F4j6pH8
633160,635160,"we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,",QGn8F4j6pH8
635160,637160,"what we bring is these values,",QGn8F4j6pH8
637160,640160,and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.,QGn8F4j6pH8
641160,642160,And it's especially rewarding when your design work,QGn8F4j6pH8
642160,644160,"becomes a creative endeavor,",QGn8F4j6pH8
645160,647160,when others can be creative and do more with it.,QGn8F4j6pH8
647160,648160,"Here's another project,",QGn8F4j6pH8
648160,651160,which I think really emulates that.,QGn8F4j6pH8
651160,656160,"This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.",QGn8F4j6pH8
658160,659160,This picture is incredible.,QGn8F4j6pH8
659160,664160,"In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.",QGn8F4j6pH8
665160,667160,This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.,QGn8F4j6pH8
667160,669160,"I mean, to me, it just means so much.",QGn8F4j6pH8
671160,673160,But when Nicholas Negroponte --,QGn8F4j6pH8
673160,675160,"and he has spoken about this project a lot,",QGn8F4j6pH8
675160,680160,he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us,QGn8F4j6pH8
680160,683160,"about two and a half years ago,",QGn8F4j6pH8
684160,686160,there were some clear ideas.,QGn8F4j6pH8
686160,689160,"He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,",QGn8F4j6pH8
690160,691160,"and those are pillars of his life,",QGn8F4j6pH8
691160,695160,but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.,QGn8F4j6pH8
697160,701160,But the third pillar that he talked about was design.,QGn8F4j6pH8
701160,705160,"And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.",QGn8F4j6pH8
705160,707160,"I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.",QGn8F4j6pH8
707160,709160,"But what he said was really significant,",QGn8F4j6pH8
710160,712160,is that design was going to be why the kids,QGn8F4j6pH8
712160,714160,"were going to love this product,",QGn8F4j6pH8
714160,716160,"how we were going to make it low cost, robust.",QGn8F4j6pH8
716160,722160,"And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --",QGn8F4j6pH8
723160,725160,(Laughter) --,QGn8F4j6pH8
725160,726160,"and the Num Lock key, too.",QGn8F4j6pH8
727160,731160,"So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic,",QGn8F4j6pH8
731160,736160,"to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.",QGn8F4j6pH8
737160,739160,And then the integration of,QGn8F4j6pH8
739160,742160,"all these great technologies, which you've heard about,",QGn8F4j6pH8
742160,745160,the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;,QGn8F4j6pH8
745160,748160,"the screen, which you can read in sunlight;",QGn8F4j6pH8
749160,751160,"the keyboard, which is made out of rubber,",QGn8F4j6pH8
751160,753160,and it's protected from the environment.,QGn8F4j6pH8
753160,756160,"You know, all these great technologies really happened",QGn8F4j6pH8
756160,760160,because of the passion and,QGn8F4j6pH8
760160,763160,the OLPC people and the engineers.,QGn8F4j6pH8
763160,765160,"They fought the suppliers,",QGn8F4j6pH8
765160,769160,they fought the manufacturers.,QGn8F4j6pH8
769160,772160,"I mean, they fought like animals",QGn8F4j6pH8
773160,775160,for this to remain they way it is.,QGn8F4j6pH8
775160,780160,"And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one --",QGn8F4j6pH8
782160,783160,allows the process,QGn8F4j6pH8
783160,785160,from not destroying the original idea.,QGn8F4j6pH8
786160,788160,And I think this is something really important.,QGn8F4j6pH8
788160,791160,"So, now you get these pictures --",QGn8F4j6pH8
791160,794160,"you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria",QGn8F4j6pH8
794160,795160,and you see them in Uruguay,QGn8F4j6pH8
796160,800160,"with their computers, and in Mongolia.",QGn8F4j6pH8
800160,803160,And we went away from obviously the beige.,QGn8F4j6pH8
803160,804160,"I mean it's colorful, it's fun.",QGn8F4j6pH8
804160,808160,"In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.",QGn8F4j6pH8
809160,811160,It's because we were able,QGn8F4j6pH8
811160,816160,"to run, during the manufacturing process,",QGn8F4j6pH8
817160,818160,"20 colors for the X and the O,",QGn8F4j6pH8
818160,820160,"which is the name of the computer,",QGn8F4j6pH8
821160,824160,"and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,",QGn8F4j6pH8
824160,827160,you get 20 times 20: you get,QGn8F4j6pH8
828160,830160,400 different options there.,QGn8F4j6pH8
830160,832160,"So, the lessons from seeing the kids",QGn8F4j6pH8
832160,834160,using them in the developing world are incredible.,QGn8F4j6pH8
834160,837160,"But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland,",QGn8F4j6pH8
838160,840160,"and he had the laptop for an afternoon,",QGn8F4j6pH8
840160,842160,and I had to take it back. It was hard.,QGn8F4j6pH8
843160,844160,(Laughter),QGn8F4j6pH8
844160,848160,"And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,",QGn8F4j6pH8
848160,849160,"I come back to Switzerland,",QGn8F4j6pH8
849160,853160,and there he is playing with his own version.,QGn8F4j6pH8
855160,856160,(Laughter),QGn8F4j6pH8
856160,858160,"Like paper, paper and cardboard.",QGn8F4j6pH8
861160,866160,"So, I'm going to finish with one last project,",QGn8F4j6pH8
866160,868160,and this is a little bit more of adult play.,QGn8F4j6pH8
869160,870160,(Laughter),QGn8F4j6pH8
870160,873160,Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.,QGn8F4j6pH8
874160,879160,"It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,",QGn8F4j6pH8
879160,881160,"February 14, about 10 days ago.",QGn8F4j6pH8
882160,886160,"So, the Department of Health in New York came to us,",QGn8F4j6pH8
886160,891160,and they needed a way to distribute,QGn8F4j6pH8
891160,896160,36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.,QGn8F4j6pH8
896160,901160,"So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.",QGn8F4j6pH8
901160,904160,These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.,QGn8F4j6pH8
904160,908160,"It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,",QGn8F4j6pH8
909160,912160,and it has to be easily serviceable:,QGn8F4j6pH8
914160,917160,you have to know where it is and what it does.,QGn8F4j6pH8
917160,921160,And we also designed the condoms themselves.,QGn8F4j6pH8
922160,924160,"And I was just in New York at the launch,",QGn8F4j6pH8
924160,927160,and I went to see all these places where they're installed:,QGn8F4j6pH8
927160,932160,this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;,QGn8F4j6pH8
932160,935160,at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.,QGn8F4j6pH8

992160,996160,"throw some condoms in the room and whatnot,",QGn8F4j6pH8

1021160,1022160,you can just say you like the design.,QGn8F4j6pH8
1022160,1025160,(Laughter),QGn8F4j6pH8
1026160,1028160,"So, I'll finish with just one thought:",QGn8F4j6pH8
1028160,1032160,"if we all work together on creating value,",QGn8F4j6pH8
1032160,1036160,"but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,",QGn8F4j6pH8
1036160,1041160,I think we can change the work that we do.,QGn8F4j6pH8
1042160,1045160,"We can change these values, can change the companies we work with,",QGn8F4j6pH8
1045160,1049160,"and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.",QGn8F4j6pH8

92229,95784,"and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean,",rXkOPv3wVZw

108167,112292,a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel,rXkOPv3wVZw
112292,117081,that summer during Shark Week. (Laughter),rXkOPv3wVZw
117081,119497,I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing,rXkOPv3wVZw
119497,122040,and optical luring of deep sea squid,rXkOPv3wVZw
122040,123817,in which I emphasized the importance,rXkOPv3wVZw
123817,129067,"of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.",rXkOPv3wVZw
129067,131792,"This came out of hundreds of dives I have made,",rXkOPv3wVZw
131792,134118,farting around in the dark,rXkOPv3wVZw
134118,136896,"using these platforms,",rXkOPv3wVZw
136896,140479,and my impression that I saw more animals,rXkOPv3wVZw
140479,142360,working from the submersible,rXkOPv3wVZw
142360,145280,than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.,rXkOPv3wVZw
145280,148650,But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.,rXkOPv3wVZw
148650,150339,But I also felt like I saw more animals,rXkOPv3wVZw
150339,152190,"working with the Tiburon than the Ventana,",rXkOPv3wVZw
152190,154375,two vehicles with the same field of view,rXkOPv3wVZw
154375,156413,but different propulsion systems.,rXkOPv3wVZw
156413,160444,So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.,rXkOPv3wVZw
160444,162700,"So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean,",rXkOPv3wVZw
162700,165860,and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance,rXkOPv3wVZw
165860,168292,and recorded the sound they made.,rXkOPv3wVZw
168292,169929,The Johnson Sea-Link -- (whirring noise) --,rXkOPv3wVZw
169929,172524,"which you can probably just barely hear here,",rXkOPv3wVZw
172524,176124,"uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.",rXkOPv3wVZw
176124,179479,The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.,rXkOPv3wVZw
179479,184558,"It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier. (Louder whirring noise)",rXkOPv3wVZw
184558,187761,But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics,rXkOPv3wVZw
187761,191199,and they sound like the Ventana. (Loud beeping noise),rXkOPv3wVZw
191199,194625,I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.,rXkOPv3wVZw
194625,197118,"So for the deep sea squid hunt,",rXkOPv3wVZw
197118,199275,I proposed using an optical lure,rXkOPv3wVZw
199275,201435,attached to a camera platform,rXkOPv3wVZw
201435,206203,"with no thrusters, no motors,",rXkOPv3wVZw
206203,208812,"just a battery-powered camera,",rXkOPv3wVZw
208812,211832,and the only illumination coming from red light,rXkOPv3wVZw
211832,214324,that's invisible to most deep-sea animals,rXkOPv3wVZw
214324,217016,that are adapted to see primarily blue.,rXkOPv3wVZw
217016,218278,"That's visible to our eye,",rXkOPv3wVZw
218278,221619,but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.,rXkOPv3wVZw
221619,224460,"So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa,",rXkOPv3wVZw
224460,226589,"could just be thrown off the back of the ship,",rXkOPv3wVZw
226589,232175,"attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line,",rXkOPv3wVZw
232175,236254,"it would just float around passively carried by the currents,",rXkOPv3wVZw
236254,240651,and the only light visible to the animals in the deep,rXkOPv3wVZw
240651,244638,"would be the blue light of the optical lure,",rXkOPv3wVZw
244638,248418,"which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly,",rXkOPv3wVZw
248418,251278,because it was designed to imitate,rXkOPv3wVZw
251278,253534,the bioluminescent display,rXkOPv3wVZw
253534,256879,of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.,rXkOPv3wVZw
256879,260440,"Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces",rXkOPv3wVZw
260440,263423,is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm,rXkOPv3wVZw
263423,265701,and is a form of defense.,rXkOPv3wVZw
265701,268882,The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure,rXkOPv3wVZw
268882,271785,"is not because giant squid eat jellyfish,",rXkOPv3wVZw
271785,276214,but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light,rXkOPv3wVZw
276214,278591,when it's being chewed on by a predator,rXkOPv3wVZw
278591,281270,and its only hope for escape,rXkOPv3wVZw
281270,284245,may be to attract the attention of a larger predator,rXkOPv3wVZw
284245,286307,that will attack its attacker,rXkOPv3wVZw
286307,288850,and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.,rXkOPv3wVZw
288850,292742,"It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape,",rXkOPv3wVZw
292742,296150,and a common form of defense in the deep sea.,rXkOPv3wVZw
296150,298263,The approach worked.,rXkOPv3wVZw
298263,301774,Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner,rXkOPv3wVZw
301774,304222,"a single video glimpse of the giant,",rXkOPv3wVZw
304222,308887,"we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.",rXkOPv3wVZw
308887,322105,Edith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.,rXkOPv3wVZw
322105,325241,"EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance --",rXkOPv3wVZw
325241,327286,"now you see me, now you don't --",rXkOPv3wVZw
327286,330289,"and we had four such teasing appearances,",rXkOPv3wVZw

354513,359367,EW: The full monty.,rXkOPv3wVZw
359367,360712,What really wowed me about that,rXkOPv3wVZw
360712,362886,was the way it came in up over the e-jelly,rXkOPv3wVZw
362886,365206,"and then attacked the enormous thing next to it,",rXkOPv3wVZw
365206,368512,which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.,rXkOPv3wVZw
368512,370931,But even more incredible was the footage shot,rXkOPv3wVZw
370931,373576,from the Triton submersible.,rXkOPv3wVZw
373576,376360,What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary,rXkOPv3wVZw
376360,379806,"was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used,",rXkOPv3wVZw
379806,383408,a one-meter long diamondback squid,rXkOPv3wVZw
383408,386120,"had a light attached to it, a squid jig",rXkOPv3wVZw
386120,388704,"of the type that longline fishermen use,",rXkOPv3wVZw
388704,390742,and I think it was this light,rXkOPv3wVZw
390742,393291,that brought the giant in.,rXkOPv3wVZw
393291,394756,"Now, what you're seeing",rXkOPv3wVZw
394756,399854,"is the intensified camera's view under red light,",rXkOPv3wVZw
399854,403976,and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.,rXkOPv3wVZw
403976,406431,"And then he got so excited,",rXkOPv3wVZw
406431,409926,"he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better,",rXkOPv3wVZw
409926,412110,"and the giant didn't run away,",rXkOPv3wVZw
412110,415351,"so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible,",rXkOPv3wVZw
415351,417887,bringing a creature of legend,rXkOPv3wVZw
417887,422858,from the misty history into high-resolution video.,rXkOPv3wVZw
422858,426126,"It was absolutely breathtaking,",rXkOPv3wVZw

454510,458325,that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.,rXkOPv3wVZw
458325,461373,Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction,rXkOPv3wVZw

139200,141819,that took place after the election.,eZj5n8ScTkI
141819,143810,"And on the other side,",eZj5n8ScTkI
143810,147631,some African-Americans dismissed or ignored,eZj5n8ScTkI
147631,151150,homophobia that was indeed real in our community.,eZj5n8ScTkI
151150,153800,And others resented this comparison,eZj5n8ScTkI
153800,156130,"between gay rights and civil rights,",eZj5n8ScTkI
156130,159675,"and once again, the sinking feeling",eZj5n8ScTkI
159675,161694,that two minority groups,eZj5n8ScTkI
161694,164144,of which I'm both a part of,eZj5n8ScTkI
164144,167086,were competing with each other,eZj5n8ScTkI
167086,169777,instead of supporting each other,eZj5n8ScTkI
169777,174303,"overwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off.",eZj5n8ScTkI
174303,177436,"Now, I'm a documentary filmmaker,",eZj5n8ScTkI
177436,180479,so after going through my pissed off stage,eZj5n8ScTkI
180479,183559,"and yelling at the television and radio,",eZj5n8ScTkI
183559,185849,my next instinct was,eZj5n8ScTkI
185849,187928,to make a movie.,eZj5n8ScTkI
187928,192280,"And what guided me in making this film was,",eZj5n8ScTkI
192280,194078,how was this happening?,eZj5n8ScTkI
194078,197278,How was it that the gay rights movement,eZj5n8ScTkI
197278,200589,was being pitted against the civil rights movement?,eZj5n8ScTkI
200589,203834,And this wasn't just an abstract question.,eZj5n8ScTkI
203834,206189,"I'm a beneficiary of both movements,",eZj5n8ScTkI
206189,209273,so this was actually personal.,eZj5n8ScTkI
209273,210868,But then something else happened,eZj5n8ScTkI
210868,213829,after that election in 2008.,eZj5n8ScTkI
213829,216217,The march towards gay equality,eZj5n8ScTkI
216217,218266,accelerated at a pace,eZj5n8ScTkI
218266,221288,"that surprised and shocked everyone,",eZj5n8ScTkI
221288,225910,"and is still reshaping our laws and our policies,",eZj5n8ScTkI
225910,228963,our institutions and our entire country.,eZj5n8ScTkI
228963,232828,And so it started to become increasingly clear to me,eZj5n8ScTkI
232828,234926,that this pitting of the two movements,eZj5n8ScTkI
234926,238508,"against each other actually didn't make sense,",eZj5n8ScTkI
238508,239740,and that they were in fact,eZj5n8ScTkI
239740,243061,"much, much more interconnected,",eZj5n8ScTkI
243061,245251,"and that, in fact, some of the way",eZj5n8ScTkI
245251,247570,that the gay rights movement has been able,eZj5n8ScTkI
247570,251145,to make such incredible gains so quickly,eZj5n8ScTkI
251145,253193,is that it's used some of the same tactics,eZj5n8ScTkI
253193,256880,and strategies that were first laid down,eZj5n8ScTkI
256880,258740,by the civil rights movement.,eZj5n8ScTkI
258740,262493,Let's just look at a few of these strategies.,eZj5n8ScTkI
262493,264772,"First off, it's really interesting to see,",eZj5n8ScTkI
264772,266740,"to actually visually see, how quick",eZj5n8ScTkI
266740,268810,"the gay rights movement has made its gains,",eZj5n8ScTkI
268810,271996,if you look at a few of the major events,eZj5n8ScTkI
271996,275720,on a timeline of both freedom movements.,eZj5n8ScTkI
275720,279302,"Now, there are tons of milestones",eZj5n8ScTkI
279302,280523,"in the civil rights movement,",eZj5n8ScTkI
280523,282416,but the first one we're going to start with,eZj5n8ScTkI
282416,286312,is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.,eZj5n8ScTkI
286312,288900,This was a protest campaign,eZj5n8ScTkI
288900,291845,"against Montgomery, Alabama's segregation",eZj5n8ScTkI
291845,293852,"on their public transit system,",eZj5n8ScTkI
293852,296711,and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks,eZj5n8ScTkI
296711,299839,refused to give up her seat to a white person.,eZj5n8ScTkI
299839,302117,"The campaign lasted a year,",eZj5n8ScTkI
302117,304216,and it galvanized the civil rights movement,eZj5n8ScTkI
304216,307183,like nothing had before it.,eZj5n8ScTkI
307183,310035,And I call this strategy the,eZj5n8ScTkI
310035,314962,"I'm tired of your foot on my neck"" strategy.""",eZj5n8ScTkI
314962,319303,So gays and lesbians have been in society,eZj5n8ScTkI
319303,321770,"since societies began,",eZj5n8ScTkI
321770,324377,"but up until the mid-20th century,",eZj5n8ScTkI
324377,328762,homosexual acts were still illegal in most states.,eZj5n8ScTkI
328762,332872,"So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott,",eZj5n8ScTkI
332872,337276,a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.,eZj5n8ScTkI
337276,340495,"It's known as Stonewall, in 1969,",eZj5n8ScTkI
340495,343710,and it's where a group of LGBT patrons,eZj5n8ScTkI
343710,346392,fought back against police beatings,eZj5n8ScTkI
346392,348348,at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked,eZj5n8ScTkI
348348,350540,three days of rioting.,eZj5n8ScTkI
350540,353266,"Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks",eZj5n8ScTkI
353266,355197,"were at the forefront of this rebellion,",eZj5n8ScTkI
355197,357466,and it's a really interesting example,eZj5n8ScTkI
357466,360677,"of the intersection of our struggles against racism,",eZj5n8ScTkI
360677,365370,"homophobia, gender identity and police brutality.",eZj5n8ScTkI
365370,368932,"After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups",eZj5n8ScTkI
368932,371271,"sprang up all over the country,",eZj5n8ScTkI
371271,375891,"and the modern gay rights
movement as we know it took off.",eZj5n8ScTkI
375891,379085,So the next moment to look at on the timeline,eZj5n8ScTkI
379085,382230,is the 1963 March on Washington.,eZj5n8ScTkI
382230,385365,"This was a seminal event
in the civil rights movement",eZj5n8ScTkI
385365,388113,and it's where African-Americans called for both,eZj5n8ScTkI
388113,391096,civil and economic justice.,eZj5n8ScTkI
391096,393275,And it's of course where Martin Luther King,eZj5n8ScTkI
393275,395538,"delivered his famous I have a dream"" speech,""",eZj5n8ScTkI
395538,397533,but what's actually less known,eZj5n8ScTkI
397533,399868,is that this march was organized,eZj5n8ScTkI
399868,403178,by a man named Bayard Rustin.,eZj5n8ScTkI
403178,405901,"Bayard was an out gay man,",eZj5n8ScTkI
405901,408533,and he's considered one of the most brilliant,eZj5n8ScTkI
408533,411450,strategists of the civil rights movement.,eZj5n8ScTkI
411450,414196,He later in his life became a fierce advocate,eZj5n8ScTkI
414196,417073,"of LGBT rights as well, and his life",eZj5n8ScTkI

422150,423467,The March on Washington,eZj5n8ScTkI

407260,410260,"what is biological and scientific fact,",uzKBGtf0i0M
410260,413260,is that we all stem from Africa --,uzKBGtf0i0M

416260,419260,"who lived 160,000 years ago.",uzKBGtf0i0M

436260,438260,My desire to disappear,uzKBGtf0i0M
438260,440260,was still very powerful.,uzKBGtf0i0M

449260,451260,and on a therapist's couch.,uzKBGtf0i0M
451260,453260,And of course I did.,uzKBGtf0i0M
453260,455260,I still believed,uzKBGtf0i0M
455260,457260,my self was all I was.,uzKBGtf0i0M
457260,459260,I still valued self-worth,uzKBGtf0i0M
459260,461260,"above all other worth,",uzKBGtf0i0M
461260,464260,and what was there to suggest otherwise?,uzKBGtf0i0M

468260,470260,to support the worth of self.,uzKBGtf0i0M
470260,472260,Look at the industry for self-image,uzKBGtf0i0M

474260,477260,the revenue it turns over.,uzKBGtf0i0M
477260,479260,We'd be right in assuming,uzKBGtf0i0M
479260,481260,that the self is an actual living thing.,uzKBGtf0i0M
481260,484260,But it's not. It's a projection,uzKBGtf0i0M
484260,486260,which our clever brains create,uzKBGtf0i0M
486260,488260,in order to cheat ourselves,uzKBGtf0i0M
488260,491260,from the reality of death.,uzKBGtf0i0M
492260,494260,But there is something,uzKBGtf0i0M
494260,496260,that can give the self,uzKBGtf0i0M
496260,499260,ultimate and infinite connection --,uzKBGtf0i0M

505260,507260,for authenticity and definition,uzKBGtf0i0M
507260,509260,will never end,uzKBGtf0i0M

511260,514260,to you and to me.,uzKBGtf0i0M
514260,517260,And that can happen with awareness --,uzKBGtf0i0M
517260,520260,awareness of the reality of oneness,uzKBGtf0i0M
520260,523260,and the projection of self-hood.,uzKBGtf0i0M
523260,525260,"For a start, we can think about",uzKBGtf0i0M
525260,528260,all the times when we do lose ourselves.,uzKBGtf0i0M
528260,530260,"It happens when I dance,",uzKBGtf0i0M

546260,550260,All my senses are alert and alive,uzKBGtf0i0M
550260,553260,in much the same way as an infant might feel --,uzKBGtf0i0M
553260,556260,that feeling of oneness.,uzKBGtf0i0M
556260,559260,"And when I'm acting a role,",uzKBGtf0i0M
559260,561260,"I inhabit another self,",uzKBGtf0i0M
561260,563260,"and I give it life for awhile,",uzKBGtf0i0M
563260,566260,because when the self is suspended,uzKBGtf0i0M
566260,568260,so is divisiveness,uzKBGtf0i0M
568260,570260,and judgment.,uzKBGtf0i0M
570260,572260,And I've played everything,uzKBGtf0i0M
572260,574260,from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery,uzKBGtf0i0M
574260,578260,to Secretary of State in 2004.,uzKBGtf0i0M
578260,580260,And no matter how other,uzKBGtf0i0M
580260,582260,"these selves might be,",uzKBGtf0i0M
582260,586260,they're all related in me.,uzKBGtf0i0M
586260,588260,And I honestly believe,uzKBGtf0i0M
588260,590260,the key to my success as an actor,uzKBGtf0i0M
590260,592260,and my progress as a person,uzKBGtf0i0M
592260,595260,has been the very lack of self,uzKBGtf0i0M
595260,597260,that used to make me feel,uzKBGtf0i0M
597260,599260,so anxious and insecure.,uzKBGtf0i0M
599260,601260,I always wondered,uzKBGtf0i0M
601260,605260,"why I could feel others' pain so deeply,",uzKBGtf0i0M
605260,607260,why I could recognize,uzKBGtf0i0M
607260,610260,the somebody in the nobody.,uzKBGtf0i0M
610260,614260,It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.,uzKBGtf0i0M
614260,617260,"I thought I lacked substance,",uzKBGtf0i0M
617260,619260,and the fact that I could feel others',uzKBGtf0i0M
619260,622260,meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.,uzKBGtf0i0M
622260,625260,The thing that was a source of shame,uzKBGtf0i0M
625260,628260,was actually a source of enlightenment.,uzKBGtf0i0M
628260,630260,And when I realized,uzKBGtf0i0M
630260,632260,and really understood,uzKBGtf0i0M
632260,635260,"that my self is a projection and that it has a function,",uzKBGtf0i0M
635260,637260,a funny thing happened.,uzKBGtf0i0M
637260,639260,I stopped giving it so much authority.,uzKBGtf0i0M
639260,641260,I give it its due.,uzKBGtf0i0M
641260,643260,I take it to therapy.,uzKBGtf0i0M
643260,645260,I've become very familiar,uzKBGtf0i0M
645260,647260,with its dysfunctional behavior.,uzKBGtf0i0M
647260,650260,But I'm not ashamed of my self.,uzKBGtf0i0M
650260,652260,"In fact, I respect my self",uzKBGtf0i0M

109753,113064,are wonderfully professional and organized.,fSErHToV8IU
113064,115935,"In fact, they have product adverts.",fSErHToV8IU
115935,118066,You can go online and buy a hacking service,fSErHToV8IU
118066,120215,to knock your business competitor offline.,fSErHToV8IU
120215,121774,Check out this one I found.,fSErHToV8IU
121774,123593,"(Video) Man: So you're here for one reason,",fSErHToV8IU
123593,125058,and that reason is,fSErHToV8IU
125058,126970,"because you need your business competitors,",fSErHToV8IU
126970,130922,"rivals, haters, or whatever the reason is, or who,",fSErHToV8IU
130922,132666,they are to go down.,fSErHToV8IU
132666,135526,"Well you, my friend, you've came to the right place.",fSErHToV8IU
135526,137942,"If you want your business competitors to go down,",fSErHToV8IU
137942,139278,"well, they can.",fSErHToV8IU
139278,142702,"If you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will.",fSErHToV8IU
142702,145729,"Not only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term",fSErHToV8IU
145729,148084,"DDOS service or scheduled attack,",fSErHToV8IU
148084,151895,starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites,fSErHToV8IU
151895,154799,to 10 to 50 dollars per hour.,fSErHToV8IU
154799,156122,"James Lyne: Now, I did actually pay",fSErHToV8IU
156122,158915,one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website.,fSErHToV8IU
158915,162409,Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company.,fSErHToV8IU
162409,164123,Turns out that's not cool.,fSErHToV8IU
164123,167133,"But regardless, it's amazing how many products",fSErHToV8IU
167133,170245,and services are available now to cybercriminals.,fSErHToV8IU
170245,172721,"For example, this testing platform,",fSErHToV8IU
172721,174436,which enables the cybercriminals,fSErHToV8IU
174436,176918,to test the quality of their viruses,fSErHToV8IU
176918,179370,before they release them on the world.,fSErHToV8IU
179370,181327,"For a small fee, they can upload it",fSErHToV8IU
181327,182993,and make sure everything is good.,fSErHToV8IU
182993,184526,But it goes further.,fSErHToV8IU
184526,186771,Cybercriminals now have crime packs,fSErHToV8IU
186771,189890,with business intelligence reporting dashboards,fSErHToV8IU
189890,193366,to manage the distribution of their malicious code.,fSErHToV8IU
193366,196894,"This is the market leader in malware distribution,",fSErHToV8IU
196894,198532,"the Black Hole Exploit Pack,",fSErHToV8IU
198532,202191,responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution,fSErHToV8IU
202191,204165,in the last couple of quarters.,fSErHToV8IU
204165,207174,"It comes with technical installation guides,",fSErHToV8IU
207174,208219,"video setup routines,",fSErHToV8IU
208219,212174,"and get this, technical support.",fSErHToV8IU
212174,214562,You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you,fSErHToV8IU
214562,218184,how to set up your illegal hacking server.,fSErHToV8IU
218184,222468,So let me show you what malicious code looks like today.,fSErHToV8IU
222468,224780,"What I've got here is two systems,",fSErHToV8IU
224780,228470,"an attacker, which I've made look all Matrix-y and scary,",fSErHToV8IU
228470,231772,"and a victim, which you might recognize from home or work.",fSErHToV8IU
231772,234501,"Now normally, these would be on different sides",fSErHToV8IU
234501,237056,"of the planet or of the Internet,",fSErHToV8IU
237056,238452,but I've put them side by side,fSErHToV8IU
238452,241116,because it makes things much more interesting.,fSErHToV8IU
241116,243171,"Now, there are many ways you can get infected.",fSErHToV8IU
243171,245763,You will have come in contact with some of them.,fSErHToV8IU
245763,247859,Maybe some of you have received an email,fSErHToV8IU
247859,251944,"that says something like, Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker,""",fSErHToV8IU
251944,254708,and I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars,fSErHToV8IU

260529,264298,was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America.,fSErHToV8IU
264298,266728,Now there are many ways you can get infected.,fSErHToV8IU
266728,268715,I want to show you a couple of my favorites.,fSErHToV8IU
268715,271375,This is a little USB key.,fSErHToV8IU
271375,273532,Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business?,fSErHToV8IU
273532,277657,"Well, you could try looking really cute.",fSErHToV8IU
277657,279595,Awww.,fSErHToV8IU
279595,281958,"Or, in my case, awkward and pathetic.",fSErHToV8IU
281958,286147,"So imagine this scenario: I walk into one of your businesses,",fSErHToV8IU
286147,288989,"looking very awkward and pathetic, with a copy of my C.V.",fSErHToV8IU
288989,290888,"which I've covered in coffee,",fSErHToV8IU
290888,294275,and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key,fSErHToV8IU
294275,296224,and print me a new one.,fSErHToV8IU
296224,299454,So let's have a look here on my victim computer.,fSErHToV8IU
299454,302700,What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key.,fSErHToV8IU
302700,304190,"After a couple of seconds,",fSErHToV8IU
304190,306941,"things start to happen on the computer on their own,",fSErHToV8IU
306941,308876,usually a bad sign.,fSErHToV8IU
308876,310570,"This would, of course, normally happen",fSErHToV8IU
310570,313328,"in a couple of seconds, really, really quickly,",fSErHToV8IU
313328,314988,but I've kind of slowed it down,fSErHToV8IU
314988,317818,so you can actually see the attack occurring.,fSErHToV8IU
317818,320335,Malware is very boring otherwise.,fSErHToV8IU
320335,322932,"So this is writing out the malicious code,",fSErHToV8IU
322932,326729,"and a few seconds later, on the left-hand side,",fSErHToV8IU
326729,331027,you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.,fSErHToV8IU
331027,332958,"Now if I place the mouse cursor over it,",fSErHToV8IU
332958,335265,"this is what we call a command prompt,",fSErHToV8IU
335265,339062,and using this we can navigate around the computer.,fSErHToV8IU
339062,341221,"We can access your documents, your data.",fSErHToV8IU
341221,342722,You can turn on the webcam.,fSErHToV8IU
342722,344351,That can be very embarrassing.,fSErHToV8IU
344351,346074,"Or just to really prove a point,",fSErHToV8IU
346074,349195,"we can launch programs like my personal favorite,",fSErHToV8IU
349195,352000,the Windows Calculator.,fSErHToV8IU
352000,354288,So isn't it amazing how much control,fSErHToV8IU
354288,357183,the attackers can get with such a simple operation?,fSErHToV8IU
357183,359114,Let me show you how most malware,fSErHToV8IU
359114,361297,is now distributed today.,fSErHToV8IU
361297,363817,What I'm going to do is open up a website,fSErHToV8IU
363817,365133,that I wrote.,fSErHToV8IU
365133,369448,It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.,fSErHToV8IU
369448,371642,And it's got a comments section here,fSErHToV8IU
371642,375323,where we can submit comments to the website.,fSErHToV8IU
375323,378330,Many of you will have used something a bit like this before.,fSErHToV8IU
378330,380277,"Unfortunately, when this was implemented,",fSErHToV8IU
380277,382702,the developer was slightly inebriated,fSErHToV8IU
382702,383944,and managed to forget,fSErHToV8IU
383944,386933,all of the secure coding practices he had learned.,fSErHToV8IU
386933,389999,"So let's imagine that our attacker,",fSErHToV8IU
389999,393447,"called Evil Hacker just for comedy value,",fSErHToV8IU
393447,395470,inserts something a little nasty.,fSErHToV8IU
395470,397169,This is a script.,fSErHToV8IU
397169,401246,It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage.,fSErHToV8IU
401246,403571,"So I'm going to submit this post,",fSErHToV8IU
403571,405953,"and then, on my victim computer,",fSErHToV8IU
405953,407980,I'm going to open up the web browser,fSErHToV8IU
407980,410233,"and browse to my website,",fSErHToV8IU
410233,414022,www.incrediblyhacked.com.,fSErHToV8IU
414022,416146,"Notice that after a couple of seconds,",fSErHToV8IU
416146,417603,I get redirected.,fSErHToV8IU
417603,419580,"That website address at the top there,",fSErHToV8IU
419580,422911,"which you can just about see, microshaft.com,",fSErHToV8IU
422911,426104,"the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs,",fSErHToV8IU
426104,430128,and up pops fake antivirus.,fSErHToV8IU
430128,435184,"This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software,",fSErHToV8IU
435184,437549,"and it will go through and it will scan the system,",fSErHToV8IU
437549,439057,have a look at what its popping up here.,fSErHToV8IU
439057,440805,It creates some very serious alerts.,fSErHToV8IU
440805,443148,"Oh look, a child porn proxy server.",fSErHToV8IU
443148,445580,We really should clean that up.,fSErHToV8IU
445580,447164,What's really insulting about this is,fSErHToV8IU
447164,451402,"not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data,",fSErHToV8IU
451402,454225,"but when the scan finishes, they tell you",fSErHToV8IU
454225,457348,"in order to clean up the fake viruses,",fSErHToV8IU
457348,460024,you have to register the product.,fSErHToV8IU
460024,463360,Now I liked it better when viruses were free.,fSErHToV8IU
463360,466139,(Laughter),fSErHToV8IU
466139,468665,People now pay cybercriminals money,fSErHToV8IU
468665,470766,"to run viruses,",fSErHToV8IU
470766,473527,which I find utterly bizarre.,fSErHToV8IU
473527,477063,"So anyway, let me change pace a little bit.",fSErHToV8IU
477063,480569,"Chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day",fSErHToV8IU
480569,482224,"is a massive challenge,",fSErHToV8IU
482224,484294,and those numbers are only growing,fSErHToV8IU
484294,488173,"directly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.",fSErHToV8IU
488173,490049,So I want to talk to you briefly,fSErHToV8IU
490049,493099,about a group of hackers we tracked for a year,fSErHToV8IU
493099,495106,and actually found --,fSErHToV8IU
495106,497683,and this is a rare treat in our job.,fSErHToV8IU
497683,500166,"Now this was a cross-industry collaboration,",fSErHToV8IU
500166,502555,"people from Facebook, independent researchers,",fSErHToV8IU
502555,504636,guys from Sophos.,fSErHToV8IU
504636,507291,So here we have a couple of documents,fSErHToV8IU
507291,510117,which our cybercriminals had uploaded,fSErHToV8IU
510117,514494,"to a cloud service, kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive,",fSErHToV8IU
514494,516703,like many of you might use.,fSErHToV8IU
516703,520095,"At the top, you'll notice a section of source code.",fSErHToV8IU
520095,523063,What this would do is send the cybercriminals,fSErHToV8IU
523063,528103,a text message every day telling them how much money,fSErHToV8IU
528103,529769,"they'd made that day,",fSErHToV8IU
529769,533065,"so a kind of cybercriminal billings report, if you will.",fSErHToV8IU
533065,535822,"If you look closely, you'll notice a series",fSErHToV8IU
535822,538805,of what are Russian telephone numbers.,fSErHToV8IU
538805,540284,"Now that's obviously interesting,",fSErHToV8IU
540284,543521,because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.,fSErHToV8IU
543521,545636,"Down below, highlighted in red,",fSErHToV8IU
545636,547387,"in the other section of source code,",fSErHToV8IU
547387,550130,"is this bit leded:leded.""""",fSErHToV8IU
550130,551419,"That's a username,",fSErHToV8IU
551419,554278,kind of like you might have on Twitter.,fSErHToV8IU
554278,555509,So let's take this a little further.,fSErHToV8IU
555509,557767,There are a few other interesting pieces,fSErHToV8IU
557767,560042,the cybercriminals had uploaded.,fSErHToV8IU
560042,562614,Lots of you here will use smartphones,fSErHToV8IU
562614,565261,to take photos and post them from the conference.,fSErHToV8IU
565261,568098,An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones,fSErHToV8IU
568098,569765,"is that when you take a photo,",fSErHToV8IU
569765,574002,it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken.,fSErHToV8IU
574002,576445,"In fact, I've been spending a lot of time",fSErHToV8IU
576445,578689,"on Internet dating sites recently,",fSErHToV8IU
578689,581100,"obviously for research purposes,",fSErHToV8IU
581100,584621,and I've noticed that about 60 percent,fSErHToV8IU
584621,587444,of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites,fSErHToV8IU
587444,591895,"contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken,",fSErHToV8IU
591895,592956,which is kind of scary,fSErHToV8IU
592956,595518,because you wouldn't give out your home address,fSErHToV8IU
595518,596967,"to lots of strangers,",fSErHToV8IU
596967,598961,but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates,fSErHToV8IU
598961,602990,to plus or minus 15 meters.,fSErHToV8IU
602990,606224,And our cybercriminals had done the same thing.,fSErHToV8IU
606224,609428,So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg.,fSErHToV8IU
609428,613114,We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.,fSErHToV8IU
613114,615509,We used Google.,fSErHToV8IU
615509,617734,"Using the email address, the telephone number",fSErHToV8IU
617734,621283,"and the GPS data, on the left you see an advert",fSErHToV8IU
621283,624952,"for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling,",fSErHToV8IU
624952,630300,on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens.,fSErHToV8IU
630300,633400,One of these was more stereotypical for me.,fSErHToV8IU
633400,637389,"A little more searching, and here's our cybercriminal.",fSErHToV8IU
637389,640935,"Imagine, these are hardened cybercriminals",fSErHToV8IU
640935,642803,sharing information scarcely.,fSErHToV8IU
642803,643951,Imagine what you could find,fSErHToV8IU
643951,645654,about each of the people in this room.,fSErHToV8IU
645654,647460,A bit more searching through the profile,fSErHToV8IU
647460,649320,and there's a photo of their office.,fSErHToV8IU
649320,651368,They were working on the third floor.,fSErHToV8IU
651368,653567,And you can also see some photos,fSErHToV8IU
653567,654742,from his business companion,fSErHToV8IU
654742,659581,where he has a taste in a certain kind of image.,fSErHToV8IU
659581,663576,It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation.,fSErHToV8IU
663576,666593,But this is where our investigation starts to slow down.,fSErHToV8IU
666593,670536,The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well.,fSErHToV8IU
670536,672571,And herein is the greatest lesson,fSErHToV8IU
672571,677149,of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now.,fSErHToV8IU
677149,680879,"Our friends, our families and our colleagues",fSErHToV8IU
680879,685568,can break our security even when we do the right things.,fSErHToV8IU
685568,688348,"This is MobSoft, one of the companies",fSErHToV8IU
688348,690514,"that this cybercriminal gang owned,",fSErHToV8IU
690514,692103,and an interesting thing about MobSoft,fSErHToV8IU
692103,694974,is the 50-percent owner of this,fSErHToV8IU
694974,696921,"posted a job advert,",fSErHToV8IU
696921,700301,and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers,fSErHToV8IU
700301,702453,from the code earlier.,fSErHToV8IU
702453,704578,"This woman was Maria,",fSErHToV8IU
704578,707458,and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals.,fSErHToV8IU
707458,710978,And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings,fSErHToV8IU
710978,713773,and clicked on every option imaginable,fSErHToV8IU
713773,717470,"to make herself really, really insecure.",fSErHToV8IU
717470,719037,"By the end of the investigation,",fSErHToV8IU
719037,722596,"where you can read the full 27-page report at that link,",fSErHToV8IU
722596,724630,"we had photos of the cybercriminals,",fSErHToV8IU
724630,727525,even the office Christmas party,fSErHToV8IU
727525,729391,when they were out on an outing.,fSErHToV8IU
729391,732640,"That's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties,",fSErHToV8IU
732640,734228,as it turns out.,fSErHToV8IU
734228,736463,Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.,fSErHToV8IU
736463,739400,Let me come back to that in just a minute.,fSErHToV8IU
739400,742147,"I want to change pace to one last little demonstration,",fSErHToV8IU
742147,746116,"a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic,",fSErHToV8IU
746116,749181,but is interesting in exposing how much information,fSErHToV8IU
749181,750957,"we're all giving away,",fSErHToV8IU
750957,755235,and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience.,fSErHToV8IU
