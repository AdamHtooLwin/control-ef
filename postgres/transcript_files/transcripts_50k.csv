15260,18260,How do you observe something you can't see?,c8re1U9rCo4
18260,21260,This is the basic question of somebody who's interested,c8re1U9rCo4
21260,23260,in finding and studying black holes.,c8re1U9rCo4
23260,25260,Because black holes are objects,c8re1U9rCo4
25260,28260,whose pull of gravity is so intense,c8re1U9rCo4
28260,30260,"that nothing can escape it, not even light,",c8re1U9rCo4
30260,32260,so you can't see it directly.,c8re1U9rCo4
32260,35260,"So, my story today about black holes",c8re1U9rCo4
35260,37260,is about one particular black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
37260,40260,I'm interested in finding whether or not,c8re1U9rCo4
40260,43260,"there is a really massive, what we like to call",c8re1U9rCo4
43260,46260,"supermassive"" black hole at the center of our galaxy.""",c8re1U9rCo4
46260,49260,And the reason this is interesting is that,c8re1U9rCo4
49260,52260,it gives us an opportunity to prove,c8re1U9rCo4
52260,56260,whether or not these exotic objects really exist.,c8re1U9rCo4
56260,58260,"And second, it gives us the opportunity",c8re1U9rCo4
58260,61260,to understand how these supermassive black holes,c8re1U9rCo4
61260,63260,"interact with their environment,",c8re1U9rCo4
63260,66260,and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution,c8re1U9rCo4
66260,69260,of the galaxies which they reside in.,c8re1U9rCo4
69260,71260,"So, to begin with,",c8re1U9rCo4
71260,74260,we need to understand what a black hole is,c8re1U9rCo4
74260,76260,so we can understand the proof of a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
76260,78260,"So, what is a black hole?",c8re1U9rCo4
78260,82260,"Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object,",c8re1U9rCo4
82260,85260,because there are only three characteristics that you can describe:,c8re1U9rCo4
85260,87260,"the mass,",c8re1U9rCo4
87260,89260,"the spin, and the charge.",c8re1U9rCo4
89260,91260,And I'm going to only talk about the mass.,c8re1U9rCo4
91260,94260,"So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.",c8re1U9rCo4
94260,96260,"But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object",c8re1U9rCo4
96260,99260,"that we need relatively exotic physics to describe,",c8re1U9rCo4
99260,103260,and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding,c8re1U9rCo4
103260,105260,of the universe.,c8re1U9rCo4
105260,107260,"But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
107260,109260,"for the proof of a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
109260,111260,is to think of it as an object,c8re1U9rCo4
111260,114260,whose mass is confined to zero volume.,c8re1U9rCo4
114260,116260,"So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about",c8re1U9rCo4
116260,119260,"an object that's supermassive,",c8re1U9rCo4
119260,121260,"and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment,",c8re1U9rCo4
121260,124260,it has no finite size.,c8re1U9rCo4
124260,126260,"So, this is a little tricky.",c8re1U9rCo4
126260,130260,"But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see,",c8re1U9rCo4
130260,133260,and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
133260,135260,And that's named after the guy who recognized,c8re1U9rCo4
135260,137260,why it was such an important radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
137260,140260,"This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.",c8re1U9rCo4
140260,142260,So why is it so important?,c8re1U9rCo4
142260,144260,It's important because it tells us,c8re1U9rCo4
144260,148260,that any object can become a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
148260,151260,"That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,",c8re1U9rCo4
151260,153260,the auditorium can become a black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
153260,156260,if you can figure out how to compress it down,c8re1U9rCo4
156260,158260,to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
158260,161260,"At that point, what's going to happen?",c8re1U9rCo4
161260,163260,At that point gravity wins.,c8re1U9rCo4
163260,165260,Gravity wins over all other known forces.,c8re1U9rCo4
165260,168260,And the object is forced to continue to collapse,c8re1U9rCo4
168260,170260,to an infinitely small object.,c8re1U9rCo4
170260,172260,And then it's a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
172260,177260,"So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,",c8re1U9rCo4
177260,179260,"it would become a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
179260,183260,because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
183260,186260,"Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.",c8re1U9rCo4
186260,190260,And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.,c8re1U9rCo4
190260,192260,It depends only on the mass of the object.,c8re1U9rCo4
192260,194260,Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.,c8re1U9rCo4
194260,197260,Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.,c8re1U9rCo4
197260,199260,"So, if I were to take the sun",c8re1U9rCo4
199260,202260,"and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,",c8re1U9rCo4
202260,205260,it would become a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
205260,208260,"So, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.",c8re1U9rCo4
208260,210260,"And it's actually quite a useful concept,",c8re1U9rCo4
210260,212260,because it tells us not only,c8re1U9rCo4
212260,214260,"when a black hole will form,",c8re1U9rCo4
214260,217260,but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
217260,219260,I only need two things.,c8re1U9rCo4
219260,221260,I need to understand the mass of the object,c8re1U9rCo4
221260,223260,"I'm claiming is a black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
223260,225260,and what its Schwarzschild radius is.,c8re1U9rCo4
225260,227260,"And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,",c8re1U9rCo4
227260,229260,there is actually only one thing I really need to know.,c8re1U9rCo4
229260,231260,"So, my job in convincing you",c8re1U9rCo4
231260,233260,that there is a black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
233260,235260,is to show that there is some object,c8re1U9rCo4
235260,238260,that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
238260,241260,And your job today is to be skeptical.,c8re1U9rCo4
241260,245260,"Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;",c8re1U9rCo4
245260,248260,I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.,c8re1U9rCo4
248260,250260,"So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,",c8re1U9rCo4
250260,253260,as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
253260,256260,An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state,c8re1U9rCo4
256260,258260,of a really massive star's life.,c8re1U9rCo4
258260,260260,"So, if a star starts its life off",c8re1U9rCo4
260260,262260,"with much more mass than the mass of the Sun,",c8re1U9rCo4
262260,265260,it's going to end its life by exploding,c8re1U9rCo4
265260,268260,and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.,c8re1U9rCo4
268260,270260,And inside that supernova remnant,c8re1U9rCo4
270260,272260,is going to be a little black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
272260,275260,that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.,c8re1U9rCo4
275260,277260,On an astronomical scale,c8re1U9rCo4
277260,279260,that's a very small black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
279260,282260,"Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.",c8re1U9rCo4
282260,286260,And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.,c8re1U9rCo4
286260,289260,And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope,c8re1U9rCo4
289260,292260,shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.,c8re1U9rCo4
292260,294260,There are big ones. There are little ones.,c8re1U9rCo4
294260,297260,Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
297260,300260,And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.,c8re1U9rCo4
300260,304260,"And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
304260,306260,just to give you a sense of scale.,c8re1U9rCo4
306260,308260,"And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
308260,310260,"which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,",c8re1U9rCo4
310260,312260,comes from the light from the stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
312260,314260,"So, we see the galaxy because of the star light.",c8re1U9rCo4
314260,318260,"Now, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.",c8re1U9rCo4
318260,321260,"I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,",c8re1U9rCo4
321260,323260,because they are kind of show offs.,c8re1U9rCo4
323260,325260,And we call them active galactic nuclei.,c8re1U9rCo4
325260,327260,"And we call them that because their nucleus,",c8re1U9rCo4
327260,330260,"or their center, are very active.",c8re1U9rCo4
330260,332260,"So, at the center there, that's actually where",c8re1U9rCo4
332260,334260,most of the starlight comes out from.,c8re1U9rCo4
334260,336260,"And yet, what we actually see is light",c8re1U9rCo4
336260,339260,that can't be explained by the starlight.,c8re1U9rCo4
339260,341260,It's way more energetic.,c8re1U9rCo4
341260,343260,"In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.",c8re1U9rCo4
343260,346260,There are also jets emanating out from the center.,c8re1U9rCo4
346260,350260,"Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain",c8re1U9rCo4
350260,352260,if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
352260,354260,"So, what people have thought is that perhaps",c8re1U9rCo4
354260,357260,there are supermassive black holes,c8re1U9rCo4
357260,360260,which matter is falling on to.,c8re1U9rCo4
360260,362260,"So, you can't see the black hole itself,",c8re1U9rCo4
362260,365260,but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
365260,367260,into the light we see.,c8re1U9rCo4
367260,369260,"So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes",c8re1U9rCo4
369260,371260,exist at the center of galaxies.,c8re1U9rCo4
371260,373260,But it's a kind of indirect argument.,c8re1U9rCo4
373260,375260,"Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion",c8re1U9rCo4
375260,378260,that maybe it's not just these prima donnas,c8re1U9rCo4
378260,380260,"that have these supermassive black holes,",c8re1U9rCo4
380260,383260,but rather all galaxies might harbor these,c8re1U9rCo4
383260,385260,supermassive black holes at their centers.,c8re1U9rCo4
385260,388260,And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy;,c8re1U9rCo4
388260,390260,what we see is the star light.,c8re1U9rCo4
390260,392260,"And if there is a supermassive black hole,",c8re1U9rCo4
392260,395260,what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.,c8re1U9rCo4
395260,398260,Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see,c8re1U9rCo4
398260,401260,in active galactic nuclei.,c8re1U9rCo4
401260,404260,If we're going to look for these stealth black holes,c8re1U9rCo4
404260,406260,"at the center of galaxies,",c8re1U9rCo4
406260,410260,"the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.",c8re1U9rCo4
410260,412260,And this is a wide field picture,c8re1U9rCo4
412260,415260,taken of the center of the Milky Way.,c8re1U9rCo4
415260,418260,And what we see is a line of stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
418260,420260,And that is because we live in a galaxy which has,c8re1U9rCo4
420260,422260,"a flattened, disk-like structure.",c8re1U9rCo4
422260,424260,"And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,",c8re1U9rCo4
424260,426260,"we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
426260,430260,or line that defines the plane of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
430260,433260,"Now, the advantage of studying our own galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
433260,436260,is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy,c8re1U9rCo4
436260,438260,"that we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
438260,441260,is 100 times further away.,c8re1U9rCo4
441260,443260,"So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
443260,445260,than anyplace else.,c8re1U9rCo4
445260,447260,"And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail",c8re1U9rCo4
447260,450260,is key to this experiment.,c8re1U9rCo4
450260,453260,"So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass",c8re1U9rCo4
453260,455260,inside a small volume?,c8re1U9rCo4
455260,458260,Which is the job that I have to show you today.,c8re1U9rCo4
458260,460260,And the tool that we use is to watch the way,c8re1U9rCo4
460260,463260,stars orbit the black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
463260,465260,Stars will orbit the black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
465260,468260,in the very same way that planets orbit the sun.,c8re1U9rCo4
468260,470260,It's the gravitational pull,c8re1U9rCo4
470260,472260,that makes these things orbit.,c8re1U9rCo4
472260,475260,"If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,",c8re1U9rCo4
475260,477260,or at least go at a much slower rate,c8re1U9rCo4
477260,480260,because all that determines how they go around,c8re1U9rCo4
480260,482260,is how much mass is inside its orbit.,c8re1U9rCo4
482260,484260,"So, this is great, because remember my job is to show",c8re1U9rCo4
484260,486260,there is a lot of mass inside a small volume.,c8re1U9rCo4
486260,489260,"So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.",c8re1U9rCo4
489260,492260,And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
492260,494260,"So, I want to see the stars",c8re1U9rCo4
494260,496260,that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.,c8re1U9rCo4
496260,500260,Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.,c8re1U9rCo4
500260,503260,"So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.",c8re1U9rCo4
503260,505260,And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used,c8re1U9rCo4
505260,507260,the world's largest telescope.,c8re1U9rCo4
507260,510260,This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes,c8re1U9rCo4
510260,512260,"with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly",c8re1U9rCo4
512260,514260,the diameter of a tennis court.,c8re1U9rCo4
514260,516260,"Now, this is wonderful,",c8re1U9rCo4
516260,518260,because the campaign promise,c8re1U9rCo4
518260,521260,"of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,",c8re1U9rCo4
521260,525260,the smaller the detail that we can see.,c8re1U9rCo4
525260,528260,"But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground",c8re1U9rCo4
528260,532260,has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.,c8re1U9rCo4
532260,534260,And that is because of the atmosphere.,c8re1U9rCo4
534260,536260,Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us,c8re1U9rCo4
536260,538260,to survive here on Earth.,c8re1U9rCo4
538260,541260,But it's relatively challenging for astronomers,c8re1U9rCo4
541260,545260,who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.,c8re1U9rCo4
545260,547260,"So, to give you a sense of what this is like,",c8re1U9rCo4
547260,549260,it's actually like looking at a pebble,c8re1U9rCo4
549260,551260,at the bottom of a stream.,c8re1U9rCo4
551260,553260,"Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,",c8re1U9rCo4
553260,556260,"the stream is continuously moving and turbulent,",c8re1U9rCo4
556260,560260,and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.,c8re1U9rCo4
560260,562260,"Very much in the same way, it's very difficult",c8re1U9rCo4
562260,564260,"to see astronomical sources, because of the",c8re1U9rCo4
564260,566260,atmosphere that's continuously moving by.,c8re1U9rCo4
566260,569260,"So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways",c8re1U9rCo4
569260,572260,"to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.",c8re1U9rCo4
572260,575260,And that buys us about a factor of 20.,c8re1U9rCo4
575260,577260,And I think all of you can agree that if you can,c8re1U9rCo4
577260,580260,"figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,",c8re1U9rCo4
580260,582260,"you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,",c8re1U9rCo4
582260,587260,"say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.",c8re1U9rCo4
587260,589260,And this animation here shows you one example of,c8re1U9rCo4
589260,592260,"the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.",c8re1U9rCo4
592260,594260,You're seeing an animation that goes between,c8re1U9rCo4
594260,597260,an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique --,c8re1U9rCo4
597260,600260,"in other words, just a picture that shows the stars --",c8re1U9rCo4
600260,602260,"and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
602260,604260,where we think the black hole is.,c8re1U9rCo4
604260,607260,"So, without this technology you can't see the stars.",c8re1U9rCo4
607260,609260,With this technology all of a sudden you can see it.,c8re1U9rCo4
609260,611260,This technology works by introducing a mirror,c8re1U9rCo4
611260,613260,into the telescope optics system,c8re1U9rCo4
613260,618260,that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.,c8re1U9rCo4
618260,622260,"So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.",c8re1U9rCo4
622260,624260,"Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on",c8re1U9rCo4
624260,626260,that little square there.,c8re1U9rCo4
626260,628260,"So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,",c8re1U9rCo4
628260,630260,although we've looked at all of them.,c8re1U9rCo4
630260,632260,"So, I want to see how these things have moved.",c8re1U9rCo4
632260,634260,"And over the course of this experiment, these stars",c8re1U9rCo4
634260,636260,have moved a tremendous amount.,c8re1U9rCo4
636260,638260,"So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,",c8re1U9rCo4
638260,640260,and we see the stars go all the way around.,c8re1U9rCo4
640260,643260,"Now, most astronomers have a favorite star,",c8re1U9rCo4
643260,647260,"and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.",c8re1U9rCo4
647260,649260,Absolutely my favorite star in the world.,c8re1U9rCo4
649260,652260,And that's because it goes around in only 15 years.,c8re1U9rCo4
652260,654260,"And to give you a sense of how short that is,",c8re1U9rCo4
654260,659260,the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
659260,662260,"Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
662260,664260,"as possible, take 500 years.",c8re1U9rCo4
664260,668260,"And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.",c8re1U9rCo4
668260,670260,"That's kind of profound, in a way.",c8re1U9rCo4
670260,672260,But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me,c8re1U9rCo4
672260,676260,how much mass is inside a very small radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
676260,679260,"So, next we see a picture here that shows you",c8re1U9rCo4
679260,681260,before this experiment the size to which we could,c8re1U9rCo4
681260,684260,confine the mass of the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
684260,686260,What we knew before is that there was four million,c8re1U9rCo4
686260,689260,times the mass of the sun inside that circle.,c8re1U9rCo4
689260,691260,"And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.",c8re1U9rCo4
691260,693260,You can see a lot of stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
693260,695260,"So, there was actually lots of alternatives",c8re1U9rCo4
695260,698260,"to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
698260,700260,because you could put a lot of stuff in there.,c8re1U9rCo4
700260,702260,"But with this experiment, we've confined",c8re1U9rCo4
702260,705260,that same mass to a much smaller volume,c8re1U9rCo4
705260,709260,"that's 10,000 times smaller.",c8re1U9rCo4
709260,711260,"And because of that, we've been able to show",c8re1U9rCo4
711260,713260,that there is a supermassive black hole there.,c8re1U9rCo4
713260,715260,"To give you a sense of how small that size is,",c8re1U9rCo4
715260,717260,that's the size of our solar system.,c8re1U9rCo4
717260,721260,"So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun",c8re1U9rCo4
721260,723260,into that small volume.,c8re1U9rCo4
723260,726260,"Now, truth in advertising. Right?",c8re1U9rCo4
726260,729260,I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.,c8re1U9rCo4
729260,731260,"And the truth is, I'm not quite there.",c8re1U9rCo4
731260,733260,But we actually have no alternative today,c8re1U9rCo4
733260,736260,to explaining this concentration of mass.,c8re1U9rCo4
736260,739260,"And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date",c8re1U9rCo4
739260,741260,for not only existence of a supermassive black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
741260,744260,"at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.",c8re1U9rCo4
744260,747260,"So, what next? I actually think",c8re1U9rCo4
747260,749260,"this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,",c8re1U9rCo4
749260,751260,so let's move on with the problem.,c8re1U9rCo4
751260,753260,"So, what I want to tell you, very briefly,",c8re1U9rCo4
753260,755260,is a few examples,c8re1U9rCo4
755260,757260,of the excitement of what we can do today,c8re1U9rCo4
757260,759260,"at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,",c8re1U9rCo4
759260,761260,"or at least we believe,",c8re1U9rCo4
761260,763260,that there is a supermassive black hole there.,c8re1U9rCo4
763260,765260,And the fun phase of this experiment,c8re1U9rCo4
765260,768260,"is, while we've tested some of our ideas",c8re1U9rCo4
768260,770260,about the consequences of a supermassive black hole,c8re1U9rCo4
770260,772260,"being at the center of our galaxy,",c8re1U9rCo4
772260,774260,almost every single one,c8re1U9rCo4
774260,776260,has been inconsistent with what we actually see.,c8re1U9rCo4
776260,778260,And that's the fun.,c8re1U9rCo4
778260,780260,"So, let me give you the two examples.",c8re1U9rCo4
780260,782260,"You can ask, What do you expect""",c8re1U9rCo4
782260,784260,"for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy",c8re1U9rCo4
784260,788260,"for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.""
305;788260;790260;What you expect there is that old stars""",c8re1U9rCo4
790260,792260,should be very clustered around the black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
792260,796260,You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.,c8re1U9rCo4
796260,800260,"Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,",c8re1U9rCo4
800260,802260,they just should not be there.,c8re1U9rCo4
802260,806260,A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.,c8re1U9rCo4
806260,810260,"To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.",c8re1U9rCo4
810260,812260,And it's a very fragile entity.,c8re1U9rCo4
812260,814260,And what does the big black hole do?,c8re1U9rCo4
814260,816260,It strips that gas cloud apart.,c8re1U9rCo4
816260,818260,It pulls much stronger on one side than the other,c8re1U9rCo4
818260,820260,and the cloud is stripped apart.,c8re1U9rCo4
820260,823260,"In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.",c8re1U9rCo4
823260,825260,"So, you shouldn't see young stars.",c8re1U9rCo4
825260,827260,"So, what do we see?",c8re1U9rCo4
827260,829260,"Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,",c8re1U9rCo4
829260,832260,we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.,c8re1U9rCo4
832260,834260,The old ones are red.,c8re1U9rCo4
834260,837260,"The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.",c8re1U9rCo4
837260,839260,"So, you can already see the surprise.",c8re1U9rCo4
839260,841260,There is a dearth of old stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
841260,845260,"There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.",c8re1U9rCo4
845260,847260,"So, this is the fun part.",c8re1U9rCo4
847260,849260,"And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,",c8re1U9rCo4
849260,851260,this mystery of how do you get --,c8re1U9rCo4
851260,853260,how do you resolve this contradiction.,c8re1U9rCo4
853260,855260,"So, in fact, my graduate students",c8re1U9rCo4
855260,859260,"are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,",c8re1U9rCo4
859260,862260,"in Hawaii, making observations to get us",c8re1U9rCo4
862260,864260,"hopefully to the next stage,",c8re1U9rCo4
864260,866260,where we can address this question,c8re1U9rCo4
866260,868260,"of why are there so many young stars,",c8re1U9rCo4
868260,870260,and so few old stars.,c8re1U9rCo4
870260,872260,To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits,c8re1U9rCo4
872260,874260,of stars that are much further away.,c8re1U9rCo4
874260,876260,To do that we'll probably need much more,c8re1U9rCo4
876260,878260,sophisticated technology than we have today.,c8re1U9rCo4
878260,880260,"Because, in truth, while I said we're correcting",c8re1U9rCo4
880260,882260,"for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only",c8re1U9rCo4
882260,884260,correct for half the errors that are introduced.,c8re1U9rCo4
884260,887260,"We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,",c8re1U9rCo4
887260,890260,and what we think we can do is if we,c8re1U9rCo4
890260,892260,shine a few more that we can correct the rest.,c8re1U9rCo4
892260,894260,So this is what we hope to do in the next few years.,c8re1U9rCo4
894260,896260,"And on a much longer time scale,",c8re1U9rCo4
896260,899260,"what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,",c8re1U9rCo4
899260,902260,"because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.",c8re1U9rCo4
902260,904260,"So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.",c8re1U9rCo4
904260,906260,And with this telescope we should be able to see,c8re1U9rCo4
906260,909260,stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
909260,911260,And we hope to be able to test some of,c8re1U9rCo4
911260,914260,"Einstein's theories of general relativity,",c8re1U9rCo4
914260,917260,some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.,c8re1U9rCo4
917260,919260,"So, we think the future of this experiment",c8re1U9rCo4
919260,922260,is quite exciting.,c8re1U9rCo4
922260,924260,"So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation",c8re1U9rCo4
924260,926260,that basically shows you how these,c8re1U9rCo4
926260,929260,"orbits have been moving, in three dimensions.",c8re1U9rCo4
929260,931260,"And I hope, if nothing else,",c8re1U9rCo4
931260,933260,"I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact",c8re1U9rCo4
933260,936260,have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.,c8re1U9rCo4
936260,939260,"And this means that these things do exist in our universe,",c8re1U9rCo4
939260,941260,"and we have to contend with this, we have to explain",c8re1U9rCo4
941260,944260,how you can get these objects in our physical world.,c8re1U9rCo4
944260,947260,"Second, we've been able to look at that interaction",c8re1U9rCo4
947260,950260,"of how supermassive black holes interact,",c8re1U9rCo4
950260,954260,"and understand, maybe, the role in which they play",c8re1U9rCo4
954260,957260,"in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.",c8re1U9rCo4
957260,959260,"And last but not least,",c8re1U9rCo4
959260,961260,none of this would have happened,c8re1U9rCo4
961260,964260,without the advent of the tremendous progress,c8re1U9rCo4
964260,966260,that's been made on the technology front.,c8re1U9rCo4
966260,970260,"And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,",c8re1U9rCo4
970260,973260,and holds a lot in store for the future.,c8re1U9rCo4
973260,975260,Thanks very much.,c8re1U9rCo4
975260,980260,(Applause),c8re1U9rCo4
12515,16118,The universe is teeming with planets.,XYNUpQrZISc
16118,17994,"I want us, in the next decade,",XYNUpQrZISc
17994,20387,to build a space telescope that'll be able to image,XYNUpQrZISc
20387,22488,an Earth about another star,XYNUpQrZISc
22488,25232,and figure out whether it can harbor life.,XYNUpQrZISc

Jet Propulsion Laboratory",XYNUpQrZISc
27392,30253,at Princeton and I are working on technology,XYNUpQrZISc
30253,33791,that will be able to do just that in the coming years.,XYNUpQrZISc
33791,35776,Astronomers now believe that every star,XYNUpQrZISc
35776,37716,"in the galaxy has a planet,",XYNUpQrZISc
37716,39992,and they speculate that up to one fifth of them,XYNUpQrZISc

57760,60082,from six billion kilometers away.,XYNUpQrZISc
60082,61650,I want to take that,XYNUpQrZISc
61650,64232,of an Earth-like planet about another star.,XYNUpQrZISc
64232,66632,Why haven't we done that? Why is that hard?,XYNUpQrZISc
66632,68054,"Well to see, let's imagine we take",XYNUpQrZISc
68054,70000,the Hubble Space Telescope,XYNUpQrZISc
70000,71698,and we turn it around and we move it out,XYNUpQrZISc

123823,126143,The light from the star is diffracting.,XYNUpQrZISc
126143,127884,"It's scattering inside the telescope,",XYNUpQrZISc

129388,131140,that washes out the planet.,XYNUpQrZISc
131140,132411,"So to see the planet,",XYNUpQrZISc
132411,134671,we have to do something about all of that light.,XYNUpQrZISc

148482,151642,"the father of the space telescope, in 1962,",XYNUpQrZISc
151642,153758,and he took his inspiration from an eclipse.,XYNUpQrZISc

155941,157981,The moon has moved in front of the sun.,XYNUpQrZISc
157981,159741,It blocks out most of the light,XYNUpQrZISc
159741,162117,so we can see that dim corona around it.,XYNUpQrZISc
162117,163780,It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up,XYNUpQrZISc
163780,166365,"and blocked that spotlight
that's getting right in my eye,",XYNUpQrZISc
166365,168277,I can see you in the back row.,XYNUpQrZISc
168277,169579,"Well, what's going on?",XYNUpQrZISc
169579,171524,Well the moon,XYNUpQrZISc
171524,173939,is casting a shadow down on the Earth.,XYNUpQrZISc
173939,177174,"We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow,",XYNUpQrZISc
177174,178685,"we look back at the sun,",XYNUpQrZISc
178685,180325,and most of the light's been removed,XYNUpQrZISc
180325,182415,"and we can see that dim, fine structure",XYNUpQrZISc
182415,183690,in the corona.,XYNUpQrZISc
183690,186357,Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.,XYNUpQrZISc
186357,189134,"We build a big screen, we fly it in space,",XYNUpQrZISc
189134,191181,"we put it up in front of the star,",XYNUpQrZISc
191181,192965,"we block out most of the light,",XYNUpQrZISc
192965,195981,"we fly a space telescope in
that shadow that's created,",XYNUpQrZISc
195981,197758,"and boom, we get to see planets.",XYNUpQrZISc
197758,200421,Well that would look something like this.,XYNUpQrZISc
200421,202010,"So there's that big screen,",XYNUpQrZISc
202010,202885,"and there's no planets,",XYNUpQrZISc
202885,205389,"because unfortunately it doesn't
actually work very well,",XYNUpQrZISc
205389,208309,because the light waves of the light and waves,XYNUpQrZISc
208309,209989,diffracts around that screen,XYNUpQrZISc
209989,211773,the same way it did in the telescope.,XYNUpQrZISc
211773,214910,"It's like water bending around a rock in a stream,",XYNUpQrZISc
214910,216700,and all that light just destroys the shadow.,XYNUpQrZISc
216700,219373,It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets.,XYNUpQrZISc
219373,221140,But Spitzer actually knew the answer.,XYNUpQrZISc
221140,223645,"If we can feather the edges, soften those edges",XYNUpQrZISc
223645,225411,"so we can control diffraction,",XYNUpQrZISc
225411,227126,"well then we can see a planet,",XYNUpQrZISc
227126,228925,and in the last 10 years or so we've come up,XYNUpQrZISc
228925,230969,with optimal solutions for doing that.,XYNUpQrZISc
230969,234501,It looks something like that.,XYNUpQrZISc
234501,236846,We call that our flower petal starshade.,XYNUpQrZISc
236846,239806,"If we make the edges of those petals exactly right,",XYNUpQrZISc
239806,241230,"if we control their shape,",XYNUpQrZISc
241230,242788,"we can control diffraction,",XYNUpQrZISc
242788,244234,and now we have a great shadow.,XYNUpQrZISc
244234,246878,"It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before,",XYNUpQrZISc
246878,250324,and we can see the planets beam out just like that.,XYNUpQrZISc
250324,252182,"That, of course, has to be bigger than my thumb.",XYNUpQrZISc
252182,253640,That starshade is about,XYNUpQrZISc
253640,255216,the size of half a football field,XYNUpQrZISc
255216,258806,"and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers
away from the telescope",XYNUpQrZISc
258806,260866,"that has to be held right in its shadow,",XYNUpQrZISc
260866,262830,and then we can see those planets.,XYNUpQrZISc
262830,264238,"This sounds formidable,",XYNUpQrZISc
264238,267246,"but brilliant engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL,",XYNUpQrZISc
267246,270126,came up with a fabulous design for how to do that,XYNUpQrZISc
270126,271200,and it looks like this.,XYNUpQrZISc
271200,272988,It starts wrapped around a hub.,XYNUpQrZISc
272988,274967,It separates from the telescope.,XYNUpQrZISc
274967,277238,"The petals unfurl, they open up,",XYNUpQrZISc
277238,278998,the telescope turns around.,XYNUpQrZISc
278998,281142,Then you'll see it flip and fly out,XYNUpQrZISc
281142,284357,"that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope.",XYNUpQrZISc
284357,286827,It's going to move in front of the star,XYNUpQrZISc
286827,290110,"just like that, creates a wonderful shadow.",XYNUpQrZISc
290110,293914,"Boom, we get planets orbiting about it.",XYNUpQrZISc
293914,295638,(Applause),XYNUpQrZISc
295638,297997,Thank you.,XYNUpQrZISc
297997,299950,That's not science fiction.,XYNUpQrZISc
299950,302513,"We've been working on this
for the last five or six years.",XYNUpQrZISc

305116,307555,out in California at Northrop Grumman.,XYNUpQrZISc
307555,309138,So those are four petals.,XYNUpQrZISc
309138,310850,This is a sub-scale star shade.,XYNUpQrZISc
310850,313347,It's about half the size of the one you just saw.,XYNUpQrZISc
313347,314807,You'll see the petals unfurl.,XYNUpQrZISc
314807,316874,Those four petals were built by four undergraduates,XYNUpQrZISc
316874,319289,doing a summer internship at JPL.,XYNUpQrZISc
319289,320535,Now you're seeing it deploy.,XYNUpQrZISc
320535,322517,Those petals have to rotate into place.,XYNUpQrZISc
322517,323687,The base of those petals,XYNUpQrZISc
323687,326060,has to go to the same place every time,XYNUpQrZISc
326060,327683,to within a tenth of a millimeter.,XYNUpQrZISc
327683,329443,"We ran this test 16 times,",XYNUpQrZISc
329443,332282,and 16 times it went into the exact same place,XYNUpQrZISc
332282,333723,to a tenth of a millimeter.,XYNUpQrZISc
333723,335655,"This has to be done very precisely,",XYNUpQrZISc
335655,338163,"but if we can do this, if we can build this technology,",XYNUpQrZISc
338163,339647,"if we can get it into space,",XYNUpQrZISc
339647,341448,you might see something like this.,XYNUpQrZISc
341448,343720,That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars,XYNUpQrZISc
343720,346314,taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.,XYNUpQrZISc
346314,348698,"If we can take a similar space telescope,",XYNUpQrZISc

354954,357890,"that's a family portrait of our
solar system -- but not ours.",XYNUpQrZISc
357890,360412,We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system,XYNUpQrZISc
360412,362044,"as seen through an occulter,",XYNUpQrZISc
362044,363114,through a starshade like that.,XYNUpQrZISc

367762,369102,next to the residual light,XYNUpQrZISc
369102,371007,is that pale blue dot. That's Earth.,XYNUpQrZISc

373381,374786,"oxygen, ozone,",XYNUpQrZISc
374786,377309,the things that might tell us that it could harbor life.,XYNUpQrZISc
377309,379718,I think this is the coolest possible science.,XYNUpQrZISc
379718,381371,"That's why I got into doing this,",XYNUpQrZISc
381371,383341,because I think that will change the world.,XYNUpQrZISc

19036,20485,A beard full of bees.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
20485,23728,"Now, this is what many of you might picture",R2kOgSVF2Uk
23728,26701,"when you think about honeybees, maybe insects,",R2kOgSVF2Uk

29789,32447,"And let me start by telling you, I gotcha.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
32447,36928,"I understand that. But, there are many things to know,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
36928,39608,"and I want you to open your minds here,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
39608,43098,"keep them open, and change your perspective about honeybees.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
43098,46063,Notice that this man is not getting stung.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
46063,49507,"He probably has a queen bee tied to his chin,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
49507,51626,and the other bees are attracted to it.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
51626,55662,"So this really demonstrates our relationship with honeybees,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
55662,59430,and that goes deep back for thousands of years.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
59430,62592,"We're very co-evolved, because we depend on bees",R2kOgSVF2Uk
62592,65552,"for pollination and, even more recently,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
65552,67376,as an economic commodity.,R2kOgSVF2Uk

70176,72753,"not just dying, but they're gone.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
72753,74555,We don't even find dead bodies.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
74555,76926,"This is called colony collapse disorder,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
76926,79138,and it's bizarre. Researchers around the globe,R2kOgSVF2Uk
79138,81584,"still do not know what's causing it,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
81584,84154,"but what we do know is that, with the declining numbers",R2kOgSVF2Uk
84154,88391,"of bees, the costs of over 130 fruit and vegetable crops",R2kOgSVF2Uk
88391,93398,that we rely on for food is going up in price.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
93398,97156,So honeybees are important for their role in the economy,R2kOgSVF2Uk
97156,99181,as well as in agriculture.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
99181,101000,Here you can see some pictures of what are called,R2kOgSVF2Uk
101000,103689,"green roofs, or urban agriculture.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
103689,105967,We're familiar with the image on the left that shows,R2kOgSVF2Uk
105967,108751,a local neighborhood garden in the South End.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
108751,111542,That's where I call home. I have a beehive in the backyard.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
111542,113961,"And perhaps a green roof in the future,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
113961,115892,"when we're further utilizing urban areas,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
115892,119350,where there are stacks of garden spaces.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
119350,122703,Check out this image above the orange line in Boston.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
122703,126180,Try to spot the beehive. It's there.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
126180,128877,"It's on the rooftop, right on the corner there,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
128877,131270,and it's been there for a couple of years now.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
131270,134522,The way that urban beekeeping currently operates,R2kOgSVF2Uk
134522,137113,"is that the beehives are quite hidden,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
137113,139140,and it's not because they need to be.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
139140,142117,"It's just because people are uncomfortable with the idea,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
142117,145791,"and that's why I want you today to try to think about this,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
145791,148074,think about the benefits of bees in cities,R2kOgSVF2Uk
148074,150333,and why they really are a terrific thing.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
150333,153303,Let me give you a brief rundown on how pollination works.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
153303,155886,"So we know flowers, we know fruits and vegetables,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
155886,159092,even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock,R2kOgSVF2Uk
159092,161555,"for the meats that we eat, rely on pollinators,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
161555,164988,"but you've got male and female parts to a plant here,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
164988,167878,and basically pollinators are attracted to plants,R2kOgSVF2Uk
167878,170905,"for their nectar, and in the process,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
170905,174280,"a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
174280,177712,"or that male kind of sperm counterpart, along the way,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
177712,180330,"and then travel to different flowers, and eventually",R2kOgSVF2Uk
180330,183449,"an apple, in this case, will be produced.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
183449,185716,You can see the orientation. The stem is down.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
185716,188670,"The blossom end has fallen off by the time we eat it,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
188670,191528,but that's a basic overview of how pollination works.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
191528,194400,"And let's think about urban living, not today,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
194400,197265,"and not in the past, but what about in a hundred years?",R2kOgSVF2Uk
197265,201203,What's it gonna look like? We have huge grand challenges,R2kOgSVF2Uk
201203,205133,"these days of habitat loss. We have more and more people,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
205133,208494,"billions of people, in 100 years, God knows how many people,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
208494,211858,"and how little space there will be to fit all of them,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
211858,215280,"so we need to change the way that we see cities, and",R2kOgSVF2Uk
215280,218643,"looking at this picture on the left of New York City today,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
218643,220510,you can see how gray and brown it is.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
220510,224041,We have tar paper on the rooftops that bounces heat back,R2kOgSVF2Uk
224041,226077,"into the atmosphere,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
226077,228412,"contributing to global climate change, no doubt.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
228412,230912,"What about in 100 years, if we have green rooftops",R2kOgSVF2Uk
230912,234075,"everywhere, and gardening, and we create our own crops",R2kOgSVF2Uk
234075,237878,"right in the cities? We save on the costs of transportation,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
237878,241974,"we save on a healthier diet, and we also educate",R2kOgSVF2Uk
241974,243676,and create new jobs locally.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
243676,248342,We need bees for the future of our cities and urban living.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
248342,251726,Here's some data that we collected through our company,R2kOgSVF2Uk
251726,254628,"with Best Bees, where we deliver, install and manage",R2kOgSVF2Uk
254628,256871,"honeybee hives for anybody who wants them,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
256871,260388,"in the city, in the countryside, and we introduce honeybees,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
260388,263247,and the idea of beekeeping in your own backyard or rooftop,R2kOgSVF2Uk
263247,265728,"or fire escape, for even that matter,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
265728,268502,and seeing how simple it is and how possible it is.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
268502,270634,There's a counterintuitive trend that we noticed,R2kOgSVF2Uk
270634,274077,"in these numbers. So let's look at the first metric here,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
274077,275477,overwintering survival.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
275477,278302,"Now this has been a huge problem for many years,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
278302,282362,"basically since the late 1980s, when the varroa mite came",R2kOgSVF2Uk
282362,285738,"and brought many different viruses, bacteria",R2kOgSVF2Uk
285738,287542,and fungal diseases with it.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
287542,289291,"Overwintering success is hard,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
289291,291584,"and that's when most of the colonies are lost,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
291584,294250,"and we found that in the cities, bees are surviving",R2kOgSVF2Uk
294250,296598,better than they are in the country.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
296598,298826,"A bit counterintuitive, right?",R2kOgSVF2Uk
298826,300908,"We think, oh, bees, countryside, agriculture,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
300908,303135,but that's not what the bees are showing.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
303135,305284,The bees like it in the city. (Laughter),R2kOgSVF2Uk
305284,308431,"Furthermore, they also produce more honey.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
308431,311000,The urban honey is delicious.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
311000,314097,"The bees in Boston on the rooftop of the Seaport Hotel,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
314097,316569,where we have hundreds of thousands of bees,R2kOgSVF2Uk
316569,318072,flying overheard right now,R2kOgSVF2Uk
318072,320377,"that I'm sure none of you noticed when we walked by,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
320377,322687,are going to all of the local community gardens,R2kOgSVF2Uk
322687,325086,"and making delicious, healthy honey",R2kOgSVF2Uk
325086,328114,that just tastes like the flowers in our city.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
328114,332901,"So the yield for urban hives, in terms of honey production,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
332901,336016,"is higher as well as the overwintering survival,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
336016,337390,compared to rural areas.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
337390,339392,"Again, a bit counterintuitive.",R2kOgSVF2Uk
339392,342713,And looking back historically at the timeline,R2kOgSVF2Uk
342713,346989,"of honeybee health, we can go back to the year 950 and see",R2kOgSVF2Uk
346989,350037,that there was also a great mortality of bees in Ireland.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
350037,353188,So the problems of bees today isn't necessarily,R2kOgSVF2Uk
353188,355813,something new. It has been happening,R2kOgSVF2Uk
355813,357880,"since over a thousand years ago,",R2kOgSVF2Uk
357880,361577,but what we don't really notice are these problems in cities.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
361577,363605,So one thing I want to encourage you to think about,R2kOgSVF2Uk
363605,366007,is the idea of what an urban island is.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
366007,369403,You think in the city maybe the temperature's warmer.,R2kOgSVF2Uk
369403,370982,Why are bees doing better in the city?,R2kOgSVF2Uk

318421,319860,I will die.,vwTDeT4v7RM

335212,337045,it's probably the same comfort,vwTDeT4v7RM
337045,338692,rating we've found in other,vwTDeT4v7RM

340188,341899,as non-comfortable.,vwTDeT4v7RM
341899,344043,So we sat together with a team,vwTDeT4v7RM
344043,346373,"which prepared the Bid Book, or goal,",vwTDeT4v7RM
346373,349148,"that we said, let's aim",vwTDeT4v7RM

351107,353750,"for outdoor comfort in this range,",vwTDeT4v7RM
353750,355421,which is perceived with a,vwTDeT4v7RM

358624,360245,"Celsius perceived temperature,",vwTDeT4v7RM
360245,362405,which is extremely comfortable.,vwTDeT4v7RM
362405,364998,People would feel really fine,vwTDeT4v7RM
364998,366892,in an open outdoor environment.,vwTDeT4v7RM
366892,368851,But what does it mean?,vwTDeT4v7RM
368851,370900,"If we just look on what happens,",vwTDeT4v7RM
370900,373011,"we see, temperature's too high.",vwTDeT4v7RM

377268,379371,we won't get much better.,vwTDeT4v7RM
379371,382092,So we need to do something active.,vwTDeT4v7RM
382092,383962,"We need, for instance, to bring",vwTDeT4v7RM
383962,386058,"in radiant cooling technology,",vwTDeT4v7RM
386058,387947,and we need to combine this,vwTDeT4v7RM
387947,390164,with so-called soft conditioning.,vwTDeT4v7RM
390164,391600,And how does it look like in a stadium?,vwTDeT4v7RM
391600,393928,So the stadium has a few,vwTDeT4v7RM
393928,395673,elements which create that,vwTDeT4v7RM
395673,396915,"outdoor comfort. First of all,",vwTDeT4v7RM
396915,399151,it's shading. It needs,vwTDeT4v7RM
399151,401465,to protect where the people,vwTDeT4v7RM
401465,403129,are sitting against strong,vwTDeT4v7RM
403129,404328,and warm wind.,vwTDeT4v7RM
404328,405967,But that's not all what we need,vwTDeT4v7RM
405967,408978,to do. We need to use,vwTDeT4v7RM
408978,411147,active systems.,vwTDeT4v7RM
411147,413587,Instead of blowing a hurricane,vwTDeT4v7RM
413587,415962,"of chilled air through the stadium,",vwTDeT4v7RM
415962,417710,we can use radiant,vwTDeT4v7RM
417710,419744,"cooling technologies, like a",vwTDeT4v7RM
419744,421944,floor heating system where water,vwTDeT4v7RM
421944,424327,pipes are embedded in the floor.,vwTDeT4v7RM
424327,426145,And just by using cold water,vwTDeT4v7RM
426145,427473,"going through the water pipes,",vwTDeT4v7RM
427473,429129,you can release the heat,vwTDeT4v7RM
429129,431209,which is absorbed during the day,vwTDeT4v7RM
431209,432446,"in the stadium, so you can",vwTDeT4v7RM
432446,434329,"create that comfort, and then by",vwTDeT4v7RM
434329,436889,adding dry air instead of,vwTDeT4v7RM
436889,439121,"down-chilled air, the spectators",vwTDeT4v7RM
439121,441003,and the football players can,vwTDeT4v7RM
441003,443336,adjust to their individual,vwTDeT4v7RM
443336,445113,"comfort needs, to their",vwTDeT4v7RM
445113,446769,individual energy balance.,vwTDeT4v7RM
446769,448746,They can adjust and find,vwTDeT4v7RM
448746,451121,their comfort they need to find.,vwTDeT4v7RM
451121,455577,There are 12 stadia probably,vwTDeT4v7RM
455577,457537,"to come, but there are",vwTDeT4v7RM
457537,459856,32 training pitches where,vwTDeT4v7RM
459856,461553,all the individual countries,vwTDeT4v7RM
461553,462737,are going to train.,vwTDeT4v7RM
462737,464634,We applied the same concept:,vwTDeT4v7RM
464634,466864,"shading of the training pitch,",vwTDeT4v7RM
466864,469704,"using a shelter against wind,",vwTDeT4v7RM
469704,471593,then using the grass.,vwTDeT4v7RM
471593,474113,Natural-watered lawn is a,vwTDeT4v7RM

475592,476809,"stabilizing temperature,",vwTDeT4v7RM

478745,479824,create comfort.,vwTDeT4v7RM
479824,483698,But even the best passive design,vwTDeT4v7RM
483698,484444,wouldn't help.,vwTDeT4v7RM
484444,485454,We need active system.,vwTDeT4v7RM
485454,486504,And how do we do that?,vwTDeT4v7RM
486504,488872,Our idea for the bid was,vwTDeT4v7RM
488872,490609,"100 percent solar cooling,",vwTDeT4v7RM

12509,16841,I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on,PB2OegI6wvI
16841,20404,involving a man named Steve Titus.,PB2OegI6wvI
20404,23433,Titus was a restaurant manager.,PB2OegI6wvI
23433,27523,"He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,",PB2OegI6wvI
27523,29418,"he was engaged to Gretchen,",PB2OegI6wvI
29418,32366,"about to be married, she was the love of his life.",PB2OegI6wvI
32366,34650,"And one night, the couple went out",PB2OegI6wvI
34650,37655,for a romantic restaurant meal.,PB2OegI6wvI
37655,39303,"They were on their way home,",PB2OegI6wvI
39303,42253,and they were pulled over by a police officer.,PB2OegI6wvI
42253,45570,"You see, Titus' car sort of resembled",PB2OegI6wvI
45570,49457,a car that was driven earlier in the evening,PB2OegI6wvI
49457,52863,"by a man who raped a female hitchhiker,",PB2OegI6wvI
52863,56457,and Titus kind of resembled that rapist.,PB2OegI6wvI
56457,59035,"So the police took a picture of Titus,",PB2OegI6wvI
59035,61802,"they put it in a photo lineup,",PB2OegI6wvI
61802,63962,"they later showed it to the victim,",PB2OegI6wvI
63962,66122,and she pointed to Titus' photo.,PB2OegI6wvI
66122,69743,"She said, That one's the closest.""""",PB2OegI6wvI
69743,73631,"The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,",PB2OegI6wvI
73631,76972,"and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,",PB2OegI6wvI
76972,79068,the rape victim got on the stand,PB2OegI6wvI
79068,83410,"and said, I'm absolutely positive that's the man.""""",PB2OegI6wvI
83410,86336,And Titus was convicted.,PB2OegI6wvI
86336,88310,"He proclaimed his innocence,",PB2OegI6wvI
88310,90892,"his family screamed at the jury,",PB2OegI6wvI
90892,93763,"his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,",PB2OegI6wvI
93763,97158,and Titus is taken away to jail.,PB2OegI6wvI
97158,100616,So what would you do at this point?,PB2OegI6wvI
100616,102252,What would you do?,PB2OegI6wvI
102252,106020,"Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,",PB2OegI6wvI
106020,108052,and yet he got an idea.,PB2OegI6wvI
108052,110483,"He called up the local newspaper,",PB2OegI6wvI
110483,113870,"he got the interest of an investigative journalist,",PB2OegI6wvI
113870,118606,"and that journalist actually found the real rapist,",PB2OegI6wvI
118606,121959,"a man who ultimately confessed to this rape,",PB2OegI6wvI
121959,125251,a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes,PB2OegI6wvI
125251,126583,"in that area,",PB2OegI6wvI
126583,129757,"and when this information was given to the judge,",PB2OegI6wvI
129757,132693,the judge set Titus free.,PB2OegI6wvI
132693,136724,"And really, that's where this case should have ended.",PB2OegI6wvI
136724,137847,It should have been over.,PB2OegI6wvI
137847,140367,"Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year,",PB2OegI6wvI
140367,144203,"a year of accusation and trial, but over.",PB2OegI6wvI
144203,146250,It didn't end that way.,PB2OegI6wvI
146250,148928,Titus was so bitter.,PB2OegI6wvI
148928,151508,He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.,PB2OegI6wvI
151508,153351,He lost his fiancée.,PB2OegI6wvI
153351,156257,She couldn't put up with his persistent anger.,PB2OegI6wvI
156257,158403,"He lost his entire savings,",PB2OegI6wvI
158403,161261,and so he decided to file a lawsuit,PB2OegI6wvI
161261,163542,against the police and others whom he felt,PB2OegI6wvI
163542,165861,were responsible for his suffering.,PB2OegI6wvI
165861,170574,"And that's when I really started working on this case,",PB2OegI6wvI
170574,172535,trying to figure out,PB2OegI6wvI
172535,174609,how did that victim go from,PB2OegI6wvI
174609,176137,"That one's the closest""""",PB2OegI6wvI
176137,180887,"to I'm absolutely positive that's the guy.""""",PB2OegI6wvI
180887,184166,"Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case.",PB2OegI6wvI
184166,187200,"He spent every waking moment thinking about it,",PB2OegI6wvI
187200,191351,"and just days before he was to have his day in court,",PB2OegI6wvI
191351,193570,"he woke up in the morning,",PB2OegI6wvI
193570,195378,"doubled over in pain,",PB2OegI6wvI
195378,198072,and died of a stress-related heart attack.,PB2OegI6wvI
198072,201259,He was 35 years old.,PB2OegI6wvI
201259,206069,So I was asked to work on Titus' case,PB2OegI6wvI
206069,208584,because I'm a psychological scientist.,PB2OegI6wvI
208584,212411,I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.,PB2OegI6wvI

302598,304839,many people believe that memory,PB2OegI6wvI

327613,332726,"You can go in there and change it, but so can other people.",PB2OegI6wvI
332726,337975,I first started studying this constructive memory process,PB2OegI6wvI
337975,340390,in the 1970s.,PB2OegI6wvI
340390,344813,I did my experiments that involved showing people,PB2OegI6wvI

478259,480560,And so what these studies are showing,PB2OegI6wvI
480560,484420,is that when you feed people misinformation,PB2OegI6wvI
484420,487800,"about some experience that they may have had,",PB2OegI6wvI
487800,493455,you can distort or contaminate or change their memory.,PB2OegI6wvI
493455,495655,"Well out there in the real world,",PB2OegI6wvI
495655,498546,misinformation is everywhere.,PB2OegI6wvI
498546,499906,We get misinformation,PB2OegI6wvI
499906,502822,"not only if we're questioned in a leading way,",PB2OegI6wvI
502822,505269,but if we talk to other witnesses,PB2OegI6wvI
505269,508302,who might consciously or inadvertently feed us,PB2OegI6wvI
508302,510439,"some erroneous information,",PB2OegI6wvI
510439,515169,"or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,",PB2OegI6wvI
515169,517962,all of these provide the opportunity,PB2OegI6wvI
517962,522312,for this kind of contamination of our memory.,PB2OegI6wvI
522312,526100,"In the 1990s, we began to see",PB2OegI6wvI
526100,530783,an even more extreme kind of memory problem.,PB2OegI6wvI
530783,533879,Some patients were going into therapy with one problem --,PB2OegI6wvI
533879,536793,"maybe they had depression, an eating disorder --",PB2OegI6wvI
536793,539546,and they were coming out of therapy,PB2OegI6wvI
539546,542207,with a different problem.,PB2OegI6wvI
542207,545908,"Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations,",PB2OegI6wvI
545908,547891,"sometimes in satanic rituals,",PB2OegI6wvI
547891,552588,sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.,PB2OegI6wvI
552588,555142,One woman came out of psychotherapy,PB2OegI6wvI
555142,557570,believing that she'd endured years,PB2OegI6wvI
557570,561472,"of ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy",PB2OegI6wvI
561472,564038,and that the baby was cut from her belly.,PB2OegI6wvI
564038,566397,But there were no physical scars,PB2OegI6wvI
566397,568423,or any kind of physical evidence,PB2OegI6wvI
568423,571304,that could have supported her story.,PB2OegI6wvI
571304,574312,"And when I began looking into these cases,",PB2OegI6wvI
574312,575762,"I was wondering,",PB2OegI6wvI
575762,578090,where do these bizarre memories come from?,PB2OegI6wvI
578090,582477,And what I found is that most of these situations,PB2OegI6wvI
582477,587968,involved some particular form of psychotherapy.,PB2OegI6wvI
587968,589567,"And so I asked,",PB2OegI6wvI
589567,592955,were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy --,PB2OegI6wvI
592955,595839,like the imagination exercises,PB2OegI6wvI
595839,597896,"or dream interpretation,",PB2OegI6wvI
597896,600028,"or in some cases hypnosis,",PB2OegI6wvI
600028,603846,or in some cases exposure to false information --,PB2OegI6wvI
603846,606633,were these leading these patients,PB2OegI6wvI
606633,609310,"to develop these very bizarre,",PB2OegI6wvI
609310,612241,unlikely memories?,PB2OegI6wvI
612241,614400,And I designed some experiments,PB2OegI6wvI
614400,619425,to try to study the processes that were being used,PB2OegI6wvI
619425,622498,in this psychotherapy so I could study,PB2OegI6wvI
622498,626049,the development of these very rich false memories.,PB2OegI6wvI
626049,628457,"In one of the first studies we did,",PB2OegI6wvI
628457,630810,"we used suggestion,",PB2OegI6wvI
630810,634873,"a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,",PB2OegI6wvI
634873,636983,we used this kind of suggestion,PB2OegI6wvI
636983,638835,and planted a false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
638835,641912,"that when you were a kid, five or six years old,",PB2OegI6wvI
641912,644163,you were lost in a shopping mall.,PB2OegI6wvI
644163,646663,You were frightened. You were crying.,PB2OegI6wvI
646663,649177,You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person,PB2OegI6wvI
649177,651029,and reunited with the family.,PB2OegI6wvI
651029,653637,And we succeeded in planting this memory,PB2OegI6wvI
653637,657743,in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.,PB2OegI6wvI
657743,659748,"And you might be thinking, well,",PB2OegI6wvI
659748,662094,that's not particularly stressful.,PB2OegI6wvI
662094,665463,But we and other investigators have planted,PB2OegI6wvI
665463,668221,rich false memories of things that were,PB2OegI6wvI
668221,671136,much more unusual and much more stressful.,PB2OegI6wvI
671136,673675,"So in a study done in Tennessee,",PB2OegI6wvI
673675,676091,researchers planted the false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
676091,678665,"that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned",PB2OegI6wvI
678665,681172,and had to be rescued by a life guard.,PB2OegI6wvI
681172,683475,"And in a study done in Canada,",PB2OegI6wvI
683475,685999,researchers planted the false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
685999,687227,"that when you were a kid,",PB2OegI6wvI
687227,690957,something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal,PB2OegI6wvI
690957,692339,"happened to you,",PB2OegI6wvI
692339,695761,succeeding with about half of their subjects.,PB2OegI6wvI
695761,698113,"And in a study done in Italy,",PB2OegI6wvI
698113,700771,"researchers planted the false memory,",PB2OegI6wvI
700771,705983,"when you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.",PB2OegI6wvI
705983,708190,I do want to add that it might seem,PB2OegI6wvI
708190,711929,like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects,PB2OegI6wvI
711929,713529,"in the name of science,",PB2OegI6wvI
713529,718167,but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation,PB2OegI6wvI
718167,720142,by research ethics boards,PB2OegI6wvI
720142,722484,that have made the decision,PB2OegI6wvI
722484,725557,that the temporary discomfort that some,PB2OegI6wvI
725557,728641,of these subjects might experience in these studies,PB2OegI6wvI
728641,732541,is outweighed by the importance of this problem,PB2OegI6wvI
732541,735648,for understanding memory processes,PB2OegI6wvI
735648,738994,and the abuse of memory that is going on,PB2OegI6wvI
738994,742287,in some places in the world.,PB2OegI6wvI
742287,745325,"Well, to my surprise,",PB2OegI6wvI
745325,748754,when I published this work and began to speak out,PB2OegI6wvI
748754,752649,"against this particular brand of psychotherapy,",PB2OegI6wvI
752649,756629,it created some pretty bad problems for me:,PB2OegI6wvI
756629,761530,"hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,",PB2OegI6wvI
761530,763206,"who felt under attack,",PB2OegI6wvI
763206,766734,and by the patients whom they had influenced.,PB2OegI6wvI
766734,769671,I had sometimes armed guards at speeches,PB2OegI6wvI
769671,771576,"that I was invited to give,",PB2OegI6wvI
771576,775793,people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.,PB2OegI6wvI
775793,777774,But probably the worst,PB2OegI6wvI
777774,780541,was I suspected that a woman,PB2OegI6wvI
780541,782965,was innocent of abuse,PB2OegI6wvI
782965,785801,that was being claimed by her grown daughter.,PB2OegI6wvI
785801,789218,She accused her mother of sexual abuse,PB2OegI6wvI
789218,791077,based on a repressed memory.,PB2OegI6wvI
791077,793960,And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story,PB2OegI6wvI
793960,797394,to be filmed and presented in public places.,PB2OegI6wvI
797394,799903,"I was suspicious of this story,",PB2OegI6wvI
799903,802203,"and so I started to investigate,",PB2OegI6wvI
802203,806686,and eventually found information that convinced me,PB2OegI6wvI
806686,808975,that this mother was innocent.,PB2OegI6wvI
808975,811936,"I published an exposé on the case,",PB2OegI6wvI
811936,815380,"and a little while later, the accusing daughter",PB2OegI6wvI
815380,816901,filed a lawsuit.,PB2OegI6wvI
816901,819256,"Even though I'd never mentioned her name,",PB2OegI6wvI
819256,823618,she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.,PB2OegI6wvI
823618,826341,And I went through nearly five years,PB2OegI6wvI
826341,832893,"of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,",PB2OegI6wvI
832893,836567,"but finally, finally, it was over and I could really",PB2OegI6wvI
836567,838991,get back to my work.,PB2OegI6wvI
838991,841476,"In the process, however, I became part",PB2OegI6wvI
841476,844130,of a disturbing trend in America,PB2OegI6wvI
844130,846237,where scientists are being sued,PB2OegI6wvI
846237,850836,for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.,PB2OegI6wvI
850836,854194,"When I got back to my work, I asked this question:",PB2OegI6wvI
854194,856592,"if I plant a false memory in your mind,",PB2OegI6wvI
856592,858436,does it have repercussions?,PB2OegI6wvI
858436,860395,"Does it affect your later thoughts,",PB2OegI6wvI
860395,862496,your later behaviors?,PB2OegI6wvI
862496,864523,Our first study planted a false memory,PB2OegI6wvI
864523,867849,that you got sick as a child eating certain foods:,PB2OegI6wvI
867849,870848,"hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.",PB2OegI6wvI
870848,874038,"And we found that once we planted this false memory,",PB2OegI6wvI
874038,876489,people didn't want to eat the foods as much,PB2OegI6wvI
876489,878749,at an outdoor picnic.,PB2OegI6wvI
878749,882622,The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.,PB2OegI6wvI
882622,884980,"If we planted a warm, fuzzy memory",PB2OegI6wvI
884980,888001,"involving a healthy food like asparagus,",PB2OegI6wvI
888001,891476,we could get people to want to eat asparagus more.,PB2OegI6wvI
891476,893850,And so what these studies are showing,PB2OegI6wvI
893850,895965,is that you can plant false memories,PB2OegI6wvI
895965,897378,and they have repercussions,PB2OegI6wvI
897378,902463,that affect behavior long after the memories take hold.,PB2OegI6wvI
902463,904887,"Well, along with this ability",PB2OegI6wvI
904887,907810,to plant memories and control behavior,PB2OegI6wvI
907810,911991,"obviously come some important ethical issues,",PB2OegI6wvI
911991,915050,"like, when should we use this mind technology?",PB2OegI6wvI
915050,918730,And should we ever ban its use?,PB2OegI6wvI
918730,921513,Therapists can't ethically plant false memories,PB2OegI6wvI
921513,923100,in the mind of their patients,PB2OegI6wvI
923100,925664,"even if it would help the patient,",PB2OegI6wvI
925664,927286,but there's nothing to stop a parent,PB2OegI6wvI
927286,931735,from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.,PB2OegI6wvI
931735,934340,"And when I suggested this publicly,",PB2OegI6wvI
934340,937686,it created an outcry again.,PB2OegI6wvI

941719,943964,"Hello, Santa Claus. (Laughter)",PB2OegI6wvI

955494,958523,"a kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan,",PB2OegI6wvI
958523,960055,"all the things that go with it,",PB2OegI6wvI
960055,963071,or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?,PB2OegI6wvI
963071,966462,I know what I would choose for a kid of mine.,PB2OegI6wvI
966462,970439,But maybe my work has made me different from most people.,PB2OegI6wvI
970439,972518,"Most people cherish their memories,",PB2OegI6wvI
972518,974672,"know that they represent their identity,",PB2OegI6wvI
974672,976697,"who they are, where they came from.",PB2OegI6wvI
976697,979555,And I appreciate that. I feel that way too.,PB2OegI6wvI
979555,981760,But I know from my work,PB2OegI6wvI
981760,986241,how much fiction is already in there.,PB2OegI6wvI
986241,988973,If I've learned anything from these decades,PB2OegI6wvI
988973,991383,"of working on these problems, it's this:",PB2OegI6wvI

1000608,1003810,it doesn't mean that it really happened.,PB2OegI6wvI
1003810,1007675,We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.,PB2OegI6wvI
1007675,1011223,We need independent corroboration.,PB2OegI6wvI
1011223,1014313,Such a discovery has made me more tolerant,PB2OegI6wvI
1014313,1016452,of the everyday memory mistakes,PB2OegI6wvI

235160,240160,but they took technology and maybe made it into things,QGn8F4j6pH8
240160,243160,"that people would use in a new way,",QGn8F4j6pH8
243160,244160,and maybe finding some new functionality.,QGn8F4j6pH8
244160,248160,"This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper, the car company,",QGn8F4j6pH8
248160,249160,"right when it launched,",QGn8F4j6pH8
249160,252160,and it's the first watch that has a display,QGn8F4j6pH8
252160,254160,that switches from horizontal to vertical.,QGn8F4j6pH8
254160,259160,"And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,",QGn8F4j6pH8
259160,260160,without bending my elbow.,QGn8F4j6pH8
260160,263160,"And other projects, which were really about transformation,",QGn8F4j6pH8
264160,267160,about matching the human need.,QGn8F4j6pH8
267160,270160,"This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,",QGn8F4j6pH8
270160,272160,"and it ships completely flat,",QGn8F4j6pH8
272160,276160,and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.,QGn8F4j6pH8
277160,278160,And something a little bit more experimental:,QGn8F4j6pH8
278160,281160,"this is a light fixture for Swarovski,",QGn8F4j6pH8
282160,284160,"and what it does is, it changes shape.",QGn8F4j6pH8
284160,288160,"So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.",QGn8F4j6pH8
288160,291160,"And just by drawing on a little computer tablet,",QGn8F4j6pH8
291160,295160,the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.,QGn8F4j6pH8
296160,298160,"And then finally, the leaf lamp for Herman Miller.",QGn8F4j6pH8
298160,300160,This is a pretty involved process;,QGn8F4j6pH8
300160,302160,it took us about four and a half years.,QGn8F4j6pH8
302160,306160,"But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,",QGn8F4j6pH8
307160,308160,a new experience of light.,QGn8F4j6pH8
308160,313160,"So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.",QGn8F4j6pH8
313160,317160,"And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.",QGn8F4j6pH8
317160,319160,And the new experience I was looking for,QGn8F4j6pH8
319160,322160,is giving the choice for the user to go from,QGn8F4j6pH8
322160,325160,"a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,",QGn8F4j6pH8
325160,328160,all the way to a bright work light.,QGn8F4j6pH8
328160,330160,"So, the light bulb actually does that.",QGn8F4j6pH8
331160,333160,"It allows the person to switch,",QGn8F4j6pH8
333160,335160,and to mix these two colorations.,QGn8F4j6pH8
335160,338160,And it's done in a very simple way:,QGn8F4j6pH8
338160,340160,"one just touches the base of the light,",QGn8F4j6pH8
341160,343160,"and on one side, you can mix the brightness,",QGn8F4j6pH8
343160,346160,"and on the other, the coloration of the light.",QGn8F4j6pH8
346160,351160,"So, all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them,",QGn8F4j6pH8
351160,353160,and I think as designers we need to really think,QGn8F4j6pH8
353160,357160,about how we can create a different relationship,QGn8F4j6pH8
357160,359160,"between our work and the world,",QGn8F4j6pH8
360160,361160,"whether it's for business,",QGn8F4j6pH8
361160,366160,"or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.",QGn8F4j6pH8
366160,371160,Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring,QGn8F4j6pH8
371160,376160,"value to business, value to the users also,",QGn8F4j6pH8
376160,380160,but I think it's the values that we put into these projects,QGn8F4j6pH8
380160,383160,that ultimately create the greater value.,QGn8F4j6pH8
384160,385160,And the values we bring,QGn8F4j6pH8
385160,389160,"can be about environmental issues,",QGn8F4j6pH8
389160,392160,"about sustainability, about lower power consumption.",QGn8F4j6pH8
392160,396160,"You know, they can be about function and beauty;",QGn8F4j6pH8
396160,397160,they can be about business strategy.,QGn8F4j6pH8
397160,399160,But designers are really the glue,QGn8F4j6pH8
400160,402160,that brings these things together.,QGn8F4j6pH8
402160,407160,"So Jawbone is a project that you're familiar with,",QGn8F4j6pH8
408160,411160,and it has a humanistic technology.,QGn8F4j6pH8
411160,414160,"It feels your skin. It rests on your skin,",QGn8F4j6pH8
414160,415160,and it knows when it is you're talking.,QGn8F4j6pH8
415160,417160,"And by knowing when it is you're talking,",QGn8F4j6pH8
418160,420160,"it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,",QGn8F4j6pH8
420160,423160,which is the environmental noises.,QGn8F4j6pH8
423160,425160,But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone,QGn8F4j6pH8
425160,430160,"is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,",QGn8F4j6pH8
431160,433160,"and all the nerdy stuff out of it,",QGn8F4j6pH8
433160,435160,and try to make it as beautiful as we can.,QGn8F4j6pH8
435160,436160,"I mean, think about it:",QGn8F4j6pH8
436160,441160,"the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,",QGn8F4j6pH8
443160,447160,"or accessories is really important,",QGn8F4j6pH8
447160,450160,"so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.",QGn8F4j6pH8
451160,454160,And this is what we're pursuing here.,QGn8F4j6pH8
454160,457160,But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.,QGn8F4j6pH8
458160,460160,"I want to point at something here, on the left.",QGn8F4j6pH8
460160,464160,"This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside",QGn8F4j6pH8
464160,466160,that makes this technology work.,QGn8F4j6pH8
466160,468160,But this is the design process:,QGn8F4j6pH8
468160,469160,"there's somebody changing the board,",QGn8F4j6pH8
469160,473160,"putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,",QGn8F4j6pH8
473160,476160,as the designers on the other side are doing the work.,QGn8F4j6pH8
476160,480160,"So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.",QGn8F4j6pH8
480160,482160,It's really about designing from the inside out.,QGn8F4j6pH8
482160,484160,"And then, on the other side of the room,",QGn8F4j6pH8
485160,486160,"the designers are making small adjustments,",QGn8F4j6pH8
486160,491160,"sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.",QGn8F4j6pH8
491160,495160,And it's what I call being design driven.,QGn8F4j6pH8
495160,496160,"You know, there is some push and pull,",QGn8F4j6pH8
497160,499160,but design is really helping define,QGn8F4j6pH8
499160,502160,the whole experience from the inside out.,QGn8F4j6pH8
503160,505160,"And then, of course, design is never done.",QGn8F4j6pH8
505160,509160,And this is -- the other new way that is unique,QGn8F4j6pH8
509160,511160,"in how we work is, because it's never done,",QGn8F4j6pH8
511160,513160,you have to do all this other stuff.,QGn8F4j6pH8
513160,516160,"The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue",QGn8F4j6pH8
516160,519160,"to really touch the user, in many ways.",QGn8F4j6pH8
520160,524160,"But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?",QGn8F4j6pH8
524160,530160,"And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,",QGn8F4j6pH8
531160,534160,"you know, really understands that you need a different structure.",QGn8F4j6pH8
534160,537160,"So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,",QGn8F4j6pH8
538160,543160,it's a partnership. We can continue to work,QGn8F4j6pH8
543160,545160,"and dedicate ourselves to this project,",QGn8F4j6pH8
546160,548160,and then we also share in the rewards.,QGn8F4j6pH8
548160,553160,"And here's another project, another partnership-type approach.",QGn8F4j6pH8
553160,555160,"This is called Y Water,",QGn8F4j6pH8
555160,558160,"and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,",QGn8F4j6pH8
559160,561160,"Austrian originally, who came to us,",QGn8F4j6pH8
561160,565160,"and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,",QGn8F4j6pH8
565160,568160,"or an organic drink for his kids,",QGn8F4j6pH8
568160,571160,to replace the high-sugar-content sodas,QGn8F4j6pH8
572160,574160,that he's trying to get them away from.,QGn8F4j6pH8
574160,576160,"So, we worked on this bottle,",QGn8F4j6pH8
577160,579160,and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.,QGn8F4j6pH8
579160,585160,And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.,QGn8F4j6pH8
586160,587160,"The bottles connect together,",QGn8F4j6pH8
587160,591160,"and you can create different shapes, different forms.",QGn8F4j6pH8
591160,592160,(Laughter),QGn8F4j6pH8
592160,594160,(Applause),QGn8F4j6pH8
594160,595160,Thank you.,QGn8F4j6pH8
595160,596160,(Applause),QGn8F4j6pH8
597160,598160,"And then while we were doing this,",QGn8F4j6pH8
598160,602160,"the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,",QGn8F4j6pH8
602160,607160,"and then we thought, well these words, why"" and ""why not,""""",QGn8F4j6pH8
607160,609160,are probably the most important words that kids ask.,QGn8F4j6pH8
610160,613160,So we called it Y Water. And so this is,QGn8F4j6pH8
613160,616160,another place where it all comes together in the same room:,QGn8F4j6pH8
616160,622160,"the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,",QGn8F4j6pH8
622160,624160,it all becomes deeply connected.,QGn8F4j6pH8
625160,627160,"And then the other thing about this project is,",QGn8F4j6pH8
627160,631160,"we bring intellectual property,",QGn8F4j6pH8
631160,633160,"we bring a marketing approach,",QGn8F4j6pH8
633160,635160,"we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,",QGn8F4j6pH8
635160,637160,"what we bring is these values,",QGn8F4j6pH8
637160,640160,and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.,QGn8F4j6pH8
641160,642160,And it's especially rewarding when your design work,QGn8F4j6pH8
642160,644160,"becomes a creative endeavor,",QGn8F4j6pH8
645160,647160,when others can be creative and do more with it.,QGn8F4j6pH8
647160,648160,"Here's another project,",QGn8F4j6pH8
648160,651160,which I think really emulates that.,QGn8F4j6pH8
651160,656160,"This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.",QGn8F4j6pH8
658160,659160,This picture is incredible.,QGn8F4j6pH8
659160,664160,"In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.",QGn8F4j6pH8
665160,667160,This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.,QGn8F4j6pH8
667160,669160,"I mean, to me, it just means so much.",QGn8F4j6pH8
671160,673160,But when Nicholas Negroponte --,QGn8F4j6pH8
673160,675160,"and he has spoken about this project a lot,",QGn8F4j6pH8
675160,680160,he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us,QGn8F4j6pH8
680160,683160,"about two and a half years ago,",QGn8F4j6pH8
684160,686160,there were some clear ideas.,QGn8F4j6pH8
686160,689160,"He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,",QGn8F4j6pH8
690160,691160,"and those are pillars of his life,",QGn8F4j6pH8
691160,695160,but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.,QGn8F4j6pH8
697160,701160,But the third pillar that he talked about was design.,QGn8F4j6pH8
701160,705160,"And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.",QGn8F4j6pH8
705160,707160,"I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.",QGn8F4j6pH8
707160,709160,"But what he said was really significant,",QGn8F4j6pH8
710160,712160,is that design was going to be why the kids,QGn8F4j6pH8
712160,714160,"were going to love this product,",QGn8F4j6pH8
714160,716160,"how we were going to make it low cost, robust.",QGn8F4j6pH8
716160,722160,"And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --",QGn8F4j6pH8
723160,725160,(Laughter) --,QGn8F4j6pH8
725160,726160,"and the Num Lock key, too.",QGn8F4j6pH8
727160,731160,"So, I was convinced. We designed it to be iconic,",QGn8F4j6pH8
731160,736160,"to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.",QGn8F4j6pH8
737160,739160,And then the integration of,QGn8F4j6pH8
739160,742160,"all these great technologies, which you've heard about,",QGn8F4j6pH8
742160,745160,the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;,QGn8F4j6pH8
745160,748160,"the screen, which you can read in sunlight;",QGn8F4j6pH8
749160,751160,"the keyboard, which is made out of rubber,",QGn8F4j6pH8
751160,753160,and it's protected from the environment.,QGn8F4j6pH8
753160,756160,"You know, all these great technologies really happened",QGn8F4j6pH8
756160,760160,because of the passion and,QGn8F4j6pH8
760160,763160,the OLPC people and the engineers.,QGn8F4j6pH8
763160,765160,"They fought the suppliers,",QGn8F4j6pH8
765160,769160,they fought the manufacturers.,QGn8F4j6pH8
769160,772160,"I mean, they fought like animals",QGn8F4j6pH8
773160,775160,for this to remain they way it is.,QGn8F4j6pH8
775160,780160,"And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one --",QGn8F4j6pH8
782160,783160,allows the process,QGn8F4j6pH8
783160,785160,from not destroying the original idea.,QGn8F4j6pH8
786160,788160,And I think this is something really important.,QGn8F4j6pH8
788160,791160,"So, now you get these pictures --",QGn8F4j6pH8
791160,794160,"you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria",QGn8F4j6pH8
794160,795160,and you see them in Uruguay,QGn8F4j6pH8
796160,800160,"with their computers, and in Mongolia.",QGn8F4j6pH8
800160,803160,And we went away from obviously the beige.,QGn8F4j6pH8
803160,804160,"I mean it's colorful, it's fun.",QGn8F4j6pH8
804160,808160,"In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.",QGn8F4j6pH8
809160,811160,It's because we were able,QGn8F4j6pH8
811160,816160,"to run, during the manufacturing process,",QGn8F4j6pH8
817160,818160,"20 colors for the X and the O,",QGn8F4j6pH8
818160,820160,"which is the name of the computer,",QGn8F4j6pH8
821160,824160,"and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,",QGn8F4j6pH8
824160,827160,you get 20 times 20: you get,QGn8F4j6pH8
828160,830160,400 different options there.,QGn8F4j6pH8
830160,832160,"So, the lessons from seeing the kids",QGn8F4j6pH8
832160,834160,using them in the developing world are incredible.,QGn8F4j6pH8
834160,837160,"But this is my nephew, Anthony, in Switzerland,",QGn8F4j6pH8
838160,840160,"and he had the laptop for an afternoon,",QGn8F4j6pH8
840160,842160,and I had to take it back. It was hard.,QGn8F4j6pH8
843160,844160,(Laughter),QGn8F4j6pH8
844160,848160,"And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,",QGn8F4j6pH8
848160,849160,"I come back to Switzerland,",QGn8F4j6pH8
849160,853160,and there he is playing with his own version.,QGn8F4j6pH8
855160,856160,(Laughter),QGn8F4j6pH8
856160,858160,"Like paper, paper and cardboard.",QGn8F4j6pH8
861160,866160,"So, I'm going to finish with one last project,",QGn8F4j6pH8
866160,868160,and this is a little bit more of adult play.,QGn8F4j6pH8
869160,870160,(Laughter),QGn8F4j6pH8
870160,873160,Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.,QGn8F4j6pH8
874160,879160,"It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,",QGn8F4j6pH8
879160,881160,"February 14, about 10 days ago.",QGn8F4j6pH8
882160,886160,"So, the Department of Health in New York came to us,",QGn8F4j6pH8
886160,891160,and they needed a way to distribute,QGn8F4j6pH8
891160,896160,36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.,QGn8F4j6pH8
896160,901160,"So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.",QGn8F4j6pH8
901160,904160,These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.,QGn8F4j6pH8
904160,908160,"It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,",QGn8F4j6pH8
909160,912160,and it has to be easily serviceable:,QGn8F4j6pH8
914160,917160,you have to know where it is and what it does.,QGn8F4j6pH8
917160,921160,And we also designed the condoms themselves.,QGn8F4j6pH8
922160,924160,"And I was just in New York at the launch,",QGn8F4j6pH8
924160,927160,and I went to see all these places where they're installed:,QGn8F4j6pH8
927160,932160,this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;,QGn8F4j6pH8
932160,935160,at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.,QGn8F4j6pH8

992160,996160,"throw some condoms in the room and whatnot,",QGn8F4j6pH8

1021160,1022160,you can just say you like the design.,QGn8F4j6pH8
1022160,1025160,(Laughter),QGn8F4j6pH8
1026160,1028160,"So, I'll finish with just one thought:",QGn8F4j6pH8
1028160,1032160,"if we all work together on creating value,",QGn8F4j6pH8
1032160,1036160,"but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,",QGn8F4j6pH8
1036160,1041160,I think we can change the work that we do.,QGn8F4j6pH8
1042160,1045160,"We can change these values, can change the companies we work with,",QGn8F4j6pH8
1045160,1049160,"and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.",QGn8F4j6pH8

92229,95784,"and he spoke with great passion about his love of the ocean,",rXkOPv3wVZw

108167,112292,a gathering of squid experts at the Discovery Channel,rXkOPv3wVZw
112292,117081,that summer during Shark Week. (Laughter),rXkOPv3wVZw
117081,119497,I gave a talk on unobtrusive viewing,rXkOPv3wVZw
119497,122040,and optical luring of deep sea squid,rXkOPv3wVZw
122040,123817,in which I emphasized the importance,rXkOPv3wVZw
123817,129067,"of using quiet, unobtrusive platforms for exploration.",rXkOPv3wVZw
129067,131792,"This came out of hundreds of dives I have made,",rXkOPv3wVZw
131792,134118,farting around in the dark,rXkOPv3wVZw
134118,136896,"using these platforms,",rXkOPv3wVZw
136896,140479,and my impression that I saw more animals,rXkOPv3wVZw
140479,142360,working from the submersible,rXkOPv3wVZw
142360,145280,than I did with either of the remote-operated vehicles.,rXkOPv3wVZw
145280,148650,But that could just be because the submersible has a wider field of view.,rXkOPv3wVZw
148650,150339,But I also felt like I saw more animals,rXkOPv3wVZw
150339,152190,"working with the Tiburon than the Ventana,",rXkOPv3wVZw
152190,154375,two vehicles with the same field of view,rXkOPv3wVZw
154375,156413,but different propulsion systems.,rXkOPv3wVZw
156413,160444,So my suspicion was that it might have something to do with the amount of noise they make.,rXkOPv3wVZw
160444,162700,"So I set up a hydrophone on the bottom of the ocean,",rXkOPv3wVZw
162700,165860,and I had each of these fly by at the same speed and distance,rXkOPv3wVZw
165860,168292,and recorded the sound they made.,rXkOPv3wVZw
168292,169929,The Johnson Sea-Link -- (whirring noise) --,rXkOPv3wVZw
169929,172524,"which you can probably just barely hear here,",rXkOPv3wVZw
172524,176124,"uses electric thrusters -- very, very quiet.",rXkOPv3wVZw
176124,179479,The Tiburon also uses electric powered thrusters.,rXkOPv3wVZw
179479,184558,"It's also pretty quiet, but a bit noisier. (Louder whirring noise)",rXkOPv3wVZw
184558,187761,But most deep-diving ROVs these days use hydraulics,rXkOPv3wVZw
187761,191199,and they sound like the Ventana. (Loud beeping noise),rXkOPv3wVZw
191199,194625,I think that's got to be scaring a lot of animals away.,rXkOPv3wVZw
194625,197118,"So for the deep sea squid hunt,",rXkOPv3wVZw
197118,199275,I proposed using an optical lure,rXkOPv3wVZw
199275,201435,attached to a camera platform,rXkOPv3wVZw
201435,206203,"with no thrusters, no motors,",rXkOPv3wVZw
206203,208812,"just a battery-powered camera,",rXkOPv3wVZw
208812,211832,and the only illumination coming from red light,rXkOPv3wVZw
211832,214324,that's invisible to most deep-sea animals,rXkOPv3wVZw
214324,217016,that are adapted to see primarily blue.,rXkOPv3wVZw
217016,218278,"That's visible to our eye,",rXkOPv3wVZw
218278,221619,but it's the equivalent of infrared in the deep sea.,rXkOPv3wVZw
221619,224460,"So this camera platform, which we called the Medusa,",rXkOPv3wVZw
224460,226589,"could just be thrown off the back of the ship,",rXkOPv3wVZw
226589,232175,"attached to a float at the surface with over 2,000 feet of line,",rXkOPv3wVZw
232175,236254,"it would just float around passively carried by the currents,",rXkOPv3wVZw
236254,240651,and the only light visible to the animals in the deep,rXkOPv3wVZw
240651,244638,"would be the blue light of the optical lure,",rXkOPv3wVZw
244638,248418,"which we called the electronic jellyfish, or e-jelly,",rXkOPv3wVZw
248418,251278,because it was designed to imitate,rXkOPv3wVZw
251278,253534,the bioluminescent display,rXkOPv3wVZw
253534,256879,of the common deep sea jellyfish Atolla.,rXkOPv3wVZw
256879,260440,"Now, this pinwheel of light that the Atolla produces",rXkOPv3wVZw
260440,263423,is known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm,rXkOPv3wVZw
263423,265701,and is a form of defense.,rXkOPv3wVZw
265701,268882,The reason that the electronic jellyfish worked as a lure,rXkOPv3wVZw
268882,271785,"is not because giant squid eat jellyfish,",rXkOPv3wVZw
271785,276214,but it's because this jellyfish only resorts to producing this light,rXkOPv3wVZw
276214,278591,when it's being chewed on by a predator,rXkOPv3wVZw
278591,281270,and its only hope for escape,rXkOPv3wVZw
281270,284245,may be to attract the attention of a larger predator,rXkOPv3wVZw
284245,286307,that will attack its attacker,rXkOPv3wVZw
286307,288850,and thereby afford it an opportunity for escape.,rXkOPv3wVZw
288850,292742,"It's a scream for help, a last-ditch attempt for escape,",rXkOPv3wVZw
292742,296150,and a common form of defense in the deep sea.,rXkOPv3wVZw
296150,298263,The approach worked.,rXkOPv3wVZw
298263,301774,Whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner,rXkOPv3wVZw
301774,304222,"a single video glimpse of the giant,",rXkOPv3wVZw
304222,308887,"we managed six, and the first triggered wild excitement.",rXkOPv3wVZw
308887,322105,Edith Widder (on video): Oh my God. Oh my God! Are you kidding me?Other scientists: Oh ho ho! That's just hanging there.,rXkOPv3wVZw
322105,325241,"EW: It was like it was teasing us, doing a kind of fan dance --",rXkOPv3wVZw
325241,327286,"now you see me, now you don't --",rXkOPv3wVZw
327286,330289,"and we had four such teasing appearances,",rXkOPv3wVZw

354513,359367,EW: The full monty.,rXkOPv3wVZw
359367,360712,What really wowed me about that,rXkOPv3wVZw
360712,362886,was the way it came in up over the e-jelly,rXkOPv3wVZw
362886,365206,"and then attacked the enormous thing next to it,",rXkOPv3wVZw
365206,368512,which I think it mistook for the predator on the e-jelly.,rXkOPv3wVZw
368512,370931,But even more incredible was the footage shot,rXkOPv3wVZw
370931,373576,from the Triton submersible.,rXkOPv3wVZw
373576,376360,What was not mentioned in the Discovery documentary,rXkOPv3wVZw
376360,379806,"was that the bait squid that Dr. Kubodera used,",rXkOPv3wVZw
379806,383408,a one-meter long diamondback squid,rXkOPv3wVZw
383408,386120,"had a light attached to it, a squid jig",rXkOPv3wVZw
386120,388704,"of the type that longline fishermen use,",rXkOPv3wVZw
388704,390742,and I think it was this light,rXkOPv3wVZw
390742,393291,that brought the giant in.,rXkOPv3wVZw
393291,394756,"Now, what you're seeing",rXkOPv3wVZw
394756,399854,"is the intensified camera's view under red light,",rXkOPv3wVZw
399854,403976,and that's all Dr. Kubodera could see when the giant comes in here.,rXkOPv3wVZw
403976,406431,"And then he got so excited,",rXkOPv3wVZw
406431,409926,"he turned on his flashlight because he wanted to see better,",rXkOPv3wVZw
409926,412110,"and the giant didn't run away,",rXkOPv3wVZw
412110,415351,"so he risked turning on the white lights on the submersible,",rXkOPv3wVZw
415351,417887,bringing a creature of legend,rXkOPv3wVZw
417887,422858,from the misty history into high-resolution video.,rXkOPv3wVZw
422858,426126,"It was absolutely breathtaking,",rXkOPv3wVZw

454510,458325,that could benefit us in ways that we can't even yet imagine.,rXkOPv3wVZw
458325,461373,Yet we have spent only a tiny fraction,rXkOPv3wVZw

139200,141819,that took place after the election.,eZj5n8ScTkI
141819,143810,"And on the other side,",eZj5n8ScTkI
143810,147631,some African-Americans dismissed or ignored,eZj5n8ScTkI
147631,151150,homophobia that was indeed real in our community.,eZj5n8ScTkI
151150,153800,And others resented this comparison,eZj5n8ScTkI
153800,156130,"between gay rights and civil rights,",eZj5n8ScTkI
156130,159675,"and once again, the sinking feeling",eZj5n8ScTkI
159675,161694,that two minority groups,eZj5n8ScTkI
161694,164144,of which I'm both a part of,eZj5n8ScTkI
164144,167086,were competing with each other,eZj5n8ScTkI
167086,169777,instead of supporting each other,eZj5n8ScTkI
169777,174303,"overwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off.",eZj5n8ScTkI
174303,177436,"Now, I'm a documentary filmmaker,",eZj5n8ScTkI
177436,180479,so after going through my pissed off stage,eZj5n8ScTkI
180479,183559,"and yelling at the television and radio,",eZj5n8ScTkI
183559,185849,my next instinct was,eZj5n8ScTkI
185849,187928,to make a movie.,eZj5n8ScTkI
187928,192280,"And what guided me in making this film was,",eZj5n8ScTkI
192280,194078,how was this happening?,eZj5n8ScTkI
194078,197278,How was it that the gay rights movement,eZj5n8ScTkI
197278,200589,was being pitted against the civil rights movement?,eZj5n8ScTkI
200589,203834,And this wasn't just an abstract question.,eZj5n8ScTkI
203834,206189,"I'm a beneficiary of both movements,",eZj5n8ScTkI
206189,209273,so this was actually personal.,eZj5n8ScTkI
209273,210868,But then something else happened,eZj5n8ScTkI
210868,213829,after that election in 2008.,eZj5n8ScTkI
213829,216217,The march towards gay equality,eZj5n8ScTkI
216217,218266,accelerated at a pace,eZj5n8ScTkI
218266,221288,"that surprised and shocked everyone,",eZj5n8ScTkI
221288,225910,"and is still reshaping our laws and our policies,",eZj5n8ScTkI
225910,228963,our institutions and our entire country.,eZj5n8ScTkI
228963,232828,And so it started to become increasingly clear to me,eZj5n8ScTkI
232828,234926,that this pitting of the two movements,eZj5n8ScTkI
234926,238508,"against each other actually didn't make sense,",eZj5n8ScTkI
238508,239740,and that they were in fact,eZj5n8ScTkI
239740,243061,"much, much more interconnected,",eZj5n8ScTkI
243061,245251,"and that, in fact, some of the way",eZj5n8ScTkI
245251,247570,that the gay rights movement has been able,eZj5n8ScTkI
247570,251145,to make such incredible gains so quickly,eZj5n8ScTkI
251145,253193,is that it's used some of the same tactics,eZj5n8ScTkI
253193,256880,and strategies that were first laid down,eZj5n8ScTkI
256880,258740,by the civil rights movement.,eZj5n8ScTkI
258740,262493,Let's just look at a few of these strategies.,eZj5n8ScTkI
262493,264772,"First off, it's really interesting to see,",eZj5n8ScTkI
264772,266740,"to actually visually see, how quick",eZj5n8ScTkI
266740,268810,"the gay rights movement has made its gains,",eZj5n8ScTkI
268810,271996,if you look at a few of the major events,eZj5n8ScTkI
271996,275720,on a timeline of both freedom movements.,eZj5n8ScTkI
275720,279302,"Now, there are tons of milestones",eZj5n8ScTkI
279302,280523,"in the civil rights movement,",eZj5n8ScTkI
280523,282416,but the first one we're going to start with,eZj5n8ScTkI
282416,286312,is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.,eZj5n8ScTkI
286312,288900,This was a protest campaign,eZj5n8ScTkI
288900,291845,"against Montgomery, Alabama's segregation",eZj5n8ScTkI
291845,293852,"on their public transit system,",eZj5n8ScTkI
293852,296711,and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks,eZj5n8ScTkI
296711,299839,refused to give up her seat to a white person.,eZj5n8ScTkI
299839,302117,"The campaign lasted a year,",eZj5n8ScTkI
302117,304216,and it galvanized the civil rights movement,eZj5n8ScTkI
304216,307183,like nothing had before it.,eZj5n8ScTkI
307183,310035,And I call this strategy the,eZj5n8ScTkI
310035,314962,"I'm tired of your foot on my neck"" strategy.""",eZj5n8ScTkI
314962,319303,So gays and lesbians have been in society,eZj5n8ScTkI
319303,321770,"since societies began,",eZj5n8ScTkI
321770,324377,"but up until the mid-20th century,",eZj5n8ScTkI
324377,328762,homosexual acts were still illegal in most states.,eZj5n8ScTkI
328762,332872,"So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott,",eZj5n8ScTkI
332872,337276,a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.,eZj5n8ScTkI
337276,340495,"It's known as Stonewall, in 1969,",eZj5n8ScTkI
340495,343710,and it's where a group of LGBT patrons,eZj5n8ScTkI
343710,346392,fought back against police beatings,eZj5n8ScTkI
346392,348348,at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked,eZj5n8ScTkI
348348,350540,three days of rioting.,eZj5n8ScTkI
350540,353266,"Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks",eZj5n8ScTkI
353266,355197,"were at the forefront of this rebellion,",eZj5n8ScTkI
355197,357466,and it's a really interesting example,eZj5n8ScTkI
357466,360677,"of the intersection of our struggles against racism,",eZj5n8ScTkI
360677,365370,"homophobia, gender identity and police brutality.",eZj5n8ScTkI
365370,368932,"After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups",eZj5n8ScTkI
368932,371271,"sprang up all over the country,",eZj5n8ScTkI
371271,375891,"and the modern gay rights
movement as we know it took off.",eZj5n8ScTkI
375891,379085,So the next moment to look at on the timeline,eZj5n8ScTkI
379085,382230,is the 1963 March on Washington.,eZj5n8ScTkI
382230,385365,"This was a seminal event
in the civil rights movement",eZj5n8ScTkI
385365,388113,and it's where African-Americans called for both,eZj5n8ScTkI
388113,391096,civil and economic justice.,eZj5n8ScTkI
391096,393275,And it's of course where Martin Luther King,eZj5n8ScTkI
393275,395538,"delivered his famous I have a dream"" speech,""",eZj5n8ScTkI
395538,397533,but what's actually less known,eZj5n8ScTkI
397533,399868,is that this march was organized,eZj5n8ScTkI
399868,403178,by a man named Bayard Rustin.,eZj5n8ScTkI
403178,405901,"Bayard was an out gay man,",eZj5n8ScTkI
405901,408533,and he's considered one of the most brilliant,eZj5n8ScTkI
408533,411450,strategists of the civil rights movement.,eZj5n8ScTkI
411450,414196,He later in his life became a fierce advocate,eZj5n8ScTkI
414196,417073,"of LGBT rights as well, and his life",eZj5n8ScTkI

422150,423467,The March on Washington,eZj5n8ScTkI

407260,410260,"what is biological and scientific fact,",uzKBGtf0i0M
410260,413260,is that we all stem from Africa --,uzKBGtf0i0M

416260,419260,"who lived 160,000 years ago.",uzKBGtf0i0M

436260,438260,My desire to disappear,uzKBGtf0i0M
438260,440260,was still very powerful.,uzKBGtf0i0M

449260,451260,and on a therapist's couch.,uzKBGtf0i0M
451260,453260,And of course I did.,uzKBGtf0i0M
453260,455260,I still believed,uzKBGtf0i0M
455260,457260,my self was all I was.,uzKBGtf0i0M
457260,459260,I still valued self-worth,uzKBGtf0i0M
459260,461260,"above all other worth,",uzKBGtf0i0M
461260,464260,and what was there to suggest otherwise?,uzKBGtf0i0M

468260,470260,to support the worth of self.,uzKBGtf0i0M
470260,472260,Look at the industry for self-image,uzKBGtf0i0M

474260,477260,the revenue it turns over.,uzKBGtf0i0M
477260,479260,We'd be right in assuming,uzKBGtf0i0M
479260,481260,that the self is an actual living thing.,uzKBGtf0i0M
481260,484260,But it's not. It's a projection,uzKBGtf0i0M
484260,486260,which our clever brains create,uzKBGtf0i0M
486260,488260,in order to cheat ourselves,uzKBGtf0i0M
488260,491260,from the reality of death.,uzKBGtf0i0M
492260,494260,But there is something,uzKBGtf0i0M
494260,496260,that can give the self,uzKBGtf0i0M
496260,499260,ultimate and infinite connection --,uzKBGtf0i0M

505260,507260,for authenticity and definition,uzKBGtf0i0M
507260,509260,will never end,uzKBGtf0i0M

511260,514260,to you and to me.,uzKBGtf0i0M
514260,517260,And that can happen with awareness --,uzKBGtf0i0M
517260,520260,awareness of the reality of oneness,uzKBGtf0i0M
520260,523260,and the projection of self-hood.,uzKBGtf0i0M
523260,525260,"For a start, we can think about",uzKBGtf0i0M
525260,528260,all the times when we do lose ourselves.,uzKBGtf0i0M
528260,530260,"It happens when I dance,",uzKBGtf0i0M

546260,550260,All my senses are alert and alive,uzKBGtf0i0M
550260,553260,in much the same way as an infant might feel --,uzKBGtf0i0M
553260,556260,that feeling of oneness.,uzKBGtf0i0M
556260,559260,"And when I'm acting a role,",uzKBGtf0i0M
559260,561260,"I inhabit another self,",uzKBGtf0i0M
561260,563260,"and I give it life for awhile,",uzKBGtf0i0M
563260,566260,because when the self is suspended,uzKBGtf0i0M
566260,568260,so is divisiveness,uzKBGtf0i0M
568260,570260,and judgment.,uzKBGtf0i0M
570260,572260,And I've played everything,uzKBGtf0i0M
572260,574260,from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery,uzKBGtf0i0M
574260,578260,to Secretary of State in 2004.,uzKBGtf0i0M
578260,580260,And no matter how other,uzKBGtf0i0M
580260,582260,"these selves might be,",uzKBGtf0i0M
582260,586260,they're all related in me.,uzKBGtf0i0M
586260,588260,And I honestly believe,uzKBGtf0i0M
588260,590260,the key to my success as an actor,uzKBGtf0i0M
590260,592260,and my progress as a person,uzKBGtf0i0M
592260,595260,has been the very lack of self,uzKBGtf0i0M
595260,597260,that used to make me feel,uzKBGtf0i0M
597260,599260,so anxious and insecure.,uzKBGtf0i0M
599260,601260,I always wondered,uzKBGtf0i0M
601260,605260,"why I could feel others' pain so deeply,",uzKBGtf0i0M
605260,607260,why I could recognize,uzKBGtf0i0M
607260,610260,the somebody in the nobody.,uzKBGtf0i0M
610260,614260,It's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.,uzKBGtf0i0M
614260,617260,"I thought I lacked substance,",uzKBGtf0i0M
617260,619260,and the fact that I could feel others',uzKBGtf0i0M
619260,622260,meant that I had nothing of myself to feel.,uzKBGtf0i0M
622260,625260,The thing that was a source of shame,uzKBGtf0i0M
625260,628260,was actually a source of enlightenment.,uzKBGtf0i0M
628260,630260,And when I realized,uzKBGtf0i0M
630260,632260,and really understood,uzKBGtf0i0M
632260,635260,"that my self is a projection and that it has a function,",uzKBGtf0i0M
635260,637260,a funny thing happened.,uzKBGtf0i0M
637260,639260,I stopped giving it so much authority.,uzKBGtf0i0M
639260,641260,I give it its due.,uzKBGtf0i0M
641260,643260,I take it to therapy.,uzKBGtf0i0M
643260,645260,I've become very familiar,uzKBGtf0i0M
645260,647260,with its dysfunctional behavior.,uzKBGtf0i0M
647260,650260,But I'm not ashamed of my self.,uzKBGtf0i0M
650260,652260,"In fact, I respect my self",uzKBGtf0i0M

109753,113064,are wonderfully professional and organized.,fSErHToV8IU
113064,115935,"In fact, they have product adverts.",fSErHToV8IU
115935,118066,You can go online and buy a hacking service,fSErHToV8IU
118066,120215,to knock your business competitor offline.,fSErHToV8IU
120215,121774,Check out this one I found.,fSErHToV8IU
121774,123593,"(Video) Man: So you're here for one reason,",fSErHToV8IU
123593,125058,and that reason is,fSErHToV8IU
125058,126970,"because you need your business competitors,",fSErHToV8IU
126970,130922,"rivals, haters, or whatever the reason is, or who,",fSErHToV8IU
130922,132666,they are to go down.,fSErHToV8IU
132666,135526,"Well you, my friend, you've came to the right place.",fSErHToV8IU
135526,137942,"If you want your business competitors to go down,",fSErHToV8IU
137942,139278,"well, they can.",fSErHToV8IU
139278,142702,"If you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will.",fSErHToV8IU
142702,145729,"Not only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term",fSErHToV8IU
145729,148084,"DDOS service or scheduled attack,",fSErHToV8IU
148084,151895,starting five dollars per hour for small personal websites,fSErHToV8IU
151895,154799,to 10 to 50 dollars per hour.,fSErHToV8IU
154799,156122,"James Lyne: Now, I did actually pay",fSErHToV8IU
156122,158915,one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website.,fSErHToV8IU
158915,162409,Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company.,fSErHToV8IU
162409,164123,Turns out that's not cool.,fSErHToV8IU
164123,167133,"But regardless, it's amazing how many products",fSErHToV8IU
167133,170245,and services are available now to cybercriminals.,fSErHToV8IU
170245,172721,"For example, this testing platform,",fSErHToV8IU
172721,174436,which enables the cybercriminals,fSErHToV8IU
174436,176918,to test the quality of their viruses,fSErHToV8IU
176918,179370,before they release them on the world.,fSErHToV8IU
179370,181327,"For a small fee, they can upload it",fSErHToV8IU
181327,182993,and make sure everything is good.,fSErHToV8IU
182993,184526,But it goes further.,fSErHToV8IU
184526,186771,Cybercriminals now have crime packs,fSErHToV8IU
186771,189890,with business intelligence reporting dashboards,fSErHToV8IU
189890,193366,to manage the distribution of their malicious code.,fSErHToV8IU
193366,196894,"This is the market leader in malware distribution,",fSErHToV8IU
196894,198532,"the Black Hole Exploit Pack,",fSErHToV8IU
198532,202191,responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution,fSErHToV8IU
202191,204165,in the last couple of quarters.,fSErHToV8IU
204165,207174,"It comes with technical installation guides,",fSErHToV8IU
207174,208219,"video setup routines,",fSErHToV8IU
208219,212174,"and get this, technical support.",fSErHToV8IU
212174,214562,You can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you,fSErHToV8IU
214562,218184,how to set up your illegal hacking server.,fSErHToV8IU
218184,222468,So let me show you what malicious code looks like today.,fSErHToV8IU
222468,224780,"What I've got here is two systems,",fSErHToV8IU
224780,228470,"an attacker, which I've made look all Matrix-y and scary,",fSErHToV8IU
228470,231772,"and a victim, which you might recognize from home or work.",fSErHToV8IU
231772,234501,"Now normally, these would be on different sides",fSErHToV8IU
234501,237056,"of the planet or of the Internet,",fSErHToV8IU
237056,238452,but I've put them side by side,fSErHToV8IU
238452,241116,because it makes things much more interesting.,fSErHToV8IU
241116,243171,"Now, there are many ways you can get infected.",fSErHToV8IU
243171,245763,You will have come in contact with some of them.,fSErHToV8IU
245763,247859,Maybe some of you have received an email,fSErHToV8IU
247859,251944,"that says something like, Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker,""",fSErHToV8IU
251944,254708,and I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars,fSErHToV8IU

260529,264298,was quite successful in China's recent campaign against America.,fSErHToV8IU
264298,266728,Now there are many ways you can get infected.,fSErHToV8IU
266728,268715,I want to show you a couple of my favorites.,fSErHToV8IU
268715,271375,This is a little USB key.,fSErHToV8IU
271375,273532,Now how do you get a USB key to run in a business?,fSErHToV8IU
273532,277657,"Well, you could try looking really cute.",fSErHToV8IU
277657,279595,Awww.,fSErHToV8IU
279595,281958,"Or, in my case, awkward and pathetic.",fSErHToV8IU
281958,286147,"So imagine this scenario: I walk into one of your businesses,",fSErHToV8IU
286147,288989,"looking very awkward and pathetic, with a copy of my C.V.",fSErHToV8IU
288989,290888,"which I've covered in coffee,",fSErHToV8IU
290888,294275,and I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key,fSErHToV8IU
294275,296224,and print me a new one.,fSErHToV8IU
296224,299454,So let's have a look here on my victim computer.,fSErHToV8IU
299454,302700,What I'm going to do is plug in the USB key.,fSErHToV8IU
302700,304190,"After a couple of seconds,",fSErHToV8IU
304190,306941,"things start to happen on the computer on their own,",fSErHToV8IU
306941,308876,usually a bad sign.,fSErHToV8IU
308876,310570,"This would, of course, normally happen",fSErHToV8IU
310570,313328,"in a couple of seconds, really, really quickly,",fSErHToV8IU
313328,314988,but I've kind of slowed it down,fSErHToV8IU
314988,317818,so you can actually see the attack occurring.,fSErHToV8IU
317818,320335,Malware is very boring otherwise.,fSErHToV8IU
320335,322932,"So this is writing out the malicious code,",fSErHToV8IU
322932,326729,"and a few seconds later, on the left-hand side,",fSErHToV8IU
326729,331027,you'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.,fSErHToV8IU
331027,332958,"Now if I place the mouse cursor over it,",fSErHToV8IU
332958,335265,"this is what we call a command prompt,",fSErHToV8IU
335265,339062,and using this we can navigate around the computer.,fSErHToV8IU
339062,341221,"We can access your documents, your data.",fSErHToV8IU
341221,342722,You can turn on the webcam.,fSErHToV8IU
342722,344351,That can be very embarrassing.,fSErHToV8IU
344351,346074,"Or just to really prove a point,",fSErHToV8IU
346074,349195,"we can launch programs like my personal favorite,",fSErHToV8IU
349195,352000,the Windows Calculator.,fSErHToV8IU
352000,354288,So isn't it amazing how much control,fSErHToV8IU
354288,357183,the attackers can get with such a simple operation?,fSErHToV8IU
357183,359114,Let me show you how most malware,fSErHToV8IU
359114,361297,is now distributed today.,fSErHToV8IU
361297,363817,What I'm going to do is open up a website,fSErHToV8IU
363817,365133,that I wrote.,fSErHToV8IU
365133,369448,It's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.,fSErHToV8IU
369448,371642,And it's got a comments section here,fSErHToV8IU
371642,375323,where we can submit comments to the website.,fSErHToV8IU
375323,378330,Many of you will have used something a bit like this before.,fSErHToV8IU
378330,380277,"Unfortunately, when this was implemented,",fSErHToV8IU
380277,382702,the developer was slightly inebriated,fSErHToV8IU
382702,383944,and managed to forget,fSErHToV8IU
383944,386933,all of the secure coding practices he had learned.,fSErHToV8IU
386933,389999,"So let's imagine that our attacker,",fSErHToV8IU
389999,393447,"called Evil Hacker just for comedy value,",fSErHToV8IU
393447,395470,inserts something a little nasty.,fSErHToV8IU
395470,397169,This is a script.,fSErHToV8IU
397169,401246,It's code which will be interpreted on the webpage.,fSErHToV8IU
401246,403571,"So I'm going to submit this post,",fSErHToV8IU
403571,405953,"and then, on my victim computer,",fSErHToV8IU
405953,407980,I'm going to open up the web browser,fSErHToV8IU
407980,410233,"and browse to my website,",fSErHToV8IU
410233,414022,www.incrediblyhacked.com.,fSErHToV8IU
414022,416146,"Notice that after a couple of seconds,",fSErHToV8IU
416146,417603,I get redirected.,fSErHToV8IU
417603,419580,"That website address at the top there,",fSErHToV8IU
419580,422911,"which you can just about see, microshaft.com,",fSErHToV8IU
422911,426104,"the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs,",fSErHToV8IU
426104,430128,and up pops fake antivirus.,fSErHToV8IU
430128,435184,"This is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software,",fSErHToV8IU
435184,437549,"and it will go through and it will scan the system,",fSErHToV8IU
437549,439057,have a look at what its popping up here.,fSErHToV8IU
439057,440805,It creates some very serious alerts.,fSErHToV8IU
440805,443148,"Oh look, a child porn proxy server.",fSErHToV8IU
443148,445580,We really should clean that up.,fSErHToV8IU
445580,447164,What's really insulting about this is,fSErHToV8IU
447164,451402,"not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data,",fSErHToV8IU
451402,454225,"but when the scan finishes, they tell you",fSErHToV8IU
454225,457348,"in order to clean up the fake viruses,",fSErHToV8IU
457348,460024,you have to register the product.,fSErHToV8IU
460024,463360,Now I liked it better when viruses were free.,fSErHToV8IU
463360,466139,(Laughter),fSErHToV8IU
466139,468665,People now pay cybercriminals money,fSErHToV8IU
468665,470766,"to run viruses,",fSErHToV8IU
470766,473527,which I find utterly bizarre.,fSErHToV8IU
473527,477063,"So anyway, let me change pace a little bit.",fSErHToV8IU
477063,480569,"Chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day",fSErHToV8IU
480569,482224,"is a massive challenge,",fSErHToV8IU
482224,484294,and those numbers are only growing,fSErHToV8IU
484294,488173,"directly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.",fSErHToV8IU
488173,490049,So I want to talk to you briefly,fSErHToV8IU
490049,493099,about a group of hackers we tracked for a year,fSErHToV8IU
493099,495106,and actually found --,fSErHToV8IU
495106,497683,and this is a rare treat in our job.,fSErHToV8IU
497683,500166,"Now this was a cross-industry collaboration,",fSErHToV8IU
500166,502555,"people from Facebook, independent researchers,",fSErHToV8IU
502555,504636,guys from Sophos.,fSErHToV8IU
504636,507291,So here we have a couple of documents,fSErHToV8IU
507291,510117,which our cybercriminals had uploaded,fSErHToV8IU
510117,514494,"to a cloud service, kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive,",fSErHToV8IU
514494,516703,like many of you might use.,fSErHToV8IU
516703,520095,"At the top, you'll notice a section of source code.",fSErHToV8IU
520095,523063,What this would do is send the cybercriminals,fSErHToV8IU
523063,528103,a text message every day telling them how much money,fSErHToV8IU
528103,529769,"they'd made that day,",fSErHToV8IU
529769,533065,"so a kind of cybercriminal billings report, if you will.",fSErHToV8IU
533065,535822,"If you look closely, you'll notice a series",fSErHToV8IU
535822,538805,of what are Russian telephone numbers.,fSErHToV8IU
538805,540284,"Now that's obviously interesting,",fSErHToV8IU
540284,543521,because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.,fSErHToV8IU
543521,545636,"Down below, highlighted in red,",fSErHToV8IU
545636,547387,"in the other section of source code,",fSErHToV8IU
547387,550130,"is this bit leded:leded.""""",fSErHToV8IU
550130,551419,"That's a username,",fSErHToV8IU
551419,554278,kind of like you might have on Twitter.,fSErHToV8IU
554278,555509,So let's take this a little further.,fSErHToV8IU
555509,557767,There are a few other interesting pieces,fSErHToV8IU
557767,560042,the cybercriminals had uploaded.,fSErHToV8IU
560042,562614,Lots of you here will use smartphones,fSErHToV8IU
562614,565261,to take photos and post them from the conference.,fSErHToV8IU
565261,568098,An interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones,fSErHToV8IU
568098,569765,"is that when you take a photo,",fSErHToV8IU
569765,574002,it embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken.,fSErHToV8IU
574002,576445,"In fact, I've been spending a lot of time",fSErHToV8IU
576445,578689,"on Internet dating sites recently,",fSErHToV8IU
578689,581100,"obviously for research purposes,",fSErHToV8IU
581100,584621,and I've noticed that about 60 percent,fSErHToV8IU
584621,587444,of the profile pictures on Internet dating sites,fSErHToV8IU
587444,591895,"contain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken,",fSErHToV8IU
591895,592956,which is kind of scary,fSErHToV8IU
592956,595518,because you wouldn't give out your home address,fSErHToV8IU
595518,596967,"to lots of strangers,",fSErHToV8IU
596967,598961,but we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates,fSErHToV8IU
598961,602990,to plus or minus 15 meters.,fSErHToV8IU
602990,606224,And our cybercriminals had done the same thing.,fSErHToV8IU
606224,609428,So here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg.,fSErHToV8IU
609428,613114,We then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.,fSErHToV8IU
613114,615509,We used Google.,fSErHToV8IU
615509,617734,"Using the email address, the telephone number",fSErHToV8IU
617734,621283,"and the GPS data, on the left you see an advert",fSErHToV8IU
621283,624952,"for a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling,",fSErHToV8IU
624952,630300,on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens.,fSErHToV8IU
630300,633400,One of these was more stereotypical for me.,fSErHToV8IU
633400,637389,"A little more searching, and here's our cybercriminal.",fSErHToV8IU
637389,640935,"Imagine, these are hardened cybercriminals",fSErHToV8IU
640935,642803,sharing information scarcely.,fSErHToV8IU
642803,643951,Imagine what you could find,fSErHToV8IU
643951,645654,about each of the people in this room.,fSErHToV8IU
645654,647460,A bit more searching through the profile,fSErHToV8IU
647460,649320,and there's a photo of their office.,fSErHToV8IU
649320,651368,They were working on the third floor.,fSErHToV8IU
651368,653567,And you can also see some photos,fSErHToV8IU
653567,654742,from his business companion,fSErHToV8IU
654742,659581,where he has a taste in a certain kind of image.,fSErHToV8IU
659581,663576,It turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation.,fSErHToV8IU
663576,666593,But this is where our investigation starts to slow down.,fSErHToV8IU
666593,670536,The cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well.,fSErHToV8IU
670536,672571,And herein is the greatest lesson,fSErHToV8IU
672571,677149,of social media and mobile devices for all of us right now.,fSErHToV8IU
677149,680879,"Our friends, our families and our colleagues",fSErHToV8IU
680879,685568,can break our security even when we do the right things.,fSErHToV8IU
685568,688348,"This is MobSoft, one of the companies",fSErHToV8IU
688348,690514,"that this cybercriminal gang owned,",fSErHToV8IU
690514,692103,and an interesting thing about MobSoft,fSErHToV8IU
692103,694974,is the 50-percent owner of this,fSErHToV8IU
694974,696921,"posted a job advert,",fSErHToV8IU
696921,700301,and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers,fSErHToV8IU
700301,702453,from the code earlier.,fSErHToV8IU
702453,704578,"This woman was Maria,",fSErHToV8IU
704578,707458,and Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals.,fSErHToV8IU
707458,710978,And it's kind of like she went into her social media settings,fSErHToV8IU
710978,713773,and clicked on every option imaginable,fSErHToV8IU
713773,717470,"to make herself really, really insecure.",fSErHToV8IU
717470,719037,"By the end of the investigation,",fSErHToV8IU
719037,722596,"where you can read the full 27-page report at that link,",fSErHToV8IU
722596,724630,"we had photos of the cybercriminals,",fSErHToV8IU
724630,727525,even the office Christmas party,fSErHToV8IU
727525,729391,when they were out on an outing.,fSErHToV8IU
729391,732640,"That's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties,",fSErHToV8IU
732640,734228,as it turns out.,fSErHToV8IU
734228,736463,Now you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.,fSErHToV8IU
736463,739400,Let me come back to that in just a minute.,fSErHToV8IU
739400,742147,"I want to change pace to one last little demonstration,",fSErHToV8IU
742147,746116,"a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic,",fSErHToV8IU
746116,749181,but is interesting in exposing how much information,fSErHToV8IU
749181,750957,"we're all giving away,",fSErHToV8IU
750957,755235,and it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience.,fSErHToV8IU

19952,23463,"also produced dramatic marginalization,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
23463,25737,resulting in the explosion of slums,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
25737,28352,in many parts of the world.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
28352,31599,This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
31599,34434,surrounded by sectors of poverty,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
34434,37816,"and the socioeconomic inequalities
they have engendered",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
37816,41378,is really at the center of today's urban crisis.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
41378,43736,But I want to begin tonight,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
43736,46174,by suggesting that this urban crisis,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
46174,50054,is not only economic or environmental.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
50054,52952,"It's particularly a cultural crisis,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
52952,55837,a crisis of the institutions,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
55837,59573,unable to reimagine the stupid ways,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
59573,61997,"which we have been growing,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
61997,65310,"unable to challenge the oil-hungry,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk

71529,76960,from southern California to New York to Dubai.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
76960,80958,So I just really want to share with you a reflection,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
80958,83282,that the future of cities today,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
83298,85989,depends less on buildings,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
85989,88404,"and, in fact, depends more",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
88404,93154,"on the fundamental reorganization
of socioeconomic relations,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
93154,95158,that the best ideas in the shaping,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
95158,96988,of the city in the future,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
96988,101037,will not come from enclaves of economic power,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
101037,102415,"and abundance,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
102415,108046,but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
108046,110886,from which an urgent imagination,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
110886,114910,can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
114910,118490,And let me illustrate what I mean,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
118490,122395,by understanding or engaging sites of conflict,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
122395,126476,"as harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
126476,129009,"to the Tijuana-San Diego border region,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
129009,133214,"which has been the laboratory to
rethink my practice as an architect.",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
133214,135726,"This is the wall, the border wall,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk

141078,143115,a physical emblem,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
143115,145765,of exclusionary planning policies,aG-ZeDqG8Zk

156547,158964,"some of the wealthiest real estate,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
158964,161431,"as I once found in the edges of San Diego,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
161431,163655,barely 20 minutes away,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
163655,167781,"from some of the poorest
settlements in Latin America.",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
167781,171144,"And while these two cities have the same population,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
171144,174980,San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
174980,176742,"in the last decades,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
176742,180132,immediately thrusting us to confront,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
180132,182179,the tensions and conflicts,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
182179,183927,"between sprawl and density,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
183927,185918,which are at the center of today's discussion,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
185918,188746,about environmental sustainability.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
188746,191478,So I've been arguing in the last years,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
191478,195183,"that, in fact, the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
195183,196844,to the sprawls of San Diego,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
196844,200374,"when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
200374,202793,that we should pay attention and learn,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
202793,205106,from the many migrant communities,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
205106,207621,on both sides of this border wall,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
207621,210958,so that we can translate their informal processes,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
210958,213017,of urbanization.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
213017,216139,What do I mean by the informal in this case?,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
216139,217967,I'm really just talking about,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
217967,221623,the compendium of social practices of adaptation,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
221623,224462,that enable many of these migrant communities,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
224462,229016,to transgress imposed political and economic recipes,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
229016,230569,of urbanization.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
230569,233819,I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
233819,236194,"of the bottom-up,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
236194,239391,whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
239391,243135,"that build themselves, in fact,
with the waste of San Diego,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
243135,245893,"or the many migrant neighborhoods
in Southern California",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
245893,248969,that have begun to be retrofitted with difference,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
248969,250626,in the last decades.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
250626,252834,So I've been interested as an artist,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
252834,255418,"in the measuring, the observation,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
255418,257690,of many of the trans-border informal flows,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
257690,259380,across this border:,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
259380,261817,"in one direction, from south to north,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
261817,264410,"the flow of immigrants into the United States,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
264410,267419,and from north to south the flow of waste,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
267419,270450,from southern California into Tijuana.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
270450,272718,I'm referring to the recycling,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
272718,276170,of these old post-war bungalows,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
276170,279629,that Mexican contractors bring to the border,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
279629,282474,as American developers are disposing of them,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
282474,285042,in the process of building a more inflated version,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
285042,287118,of suburbia in the last decades.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
287118,290033,So these are houses waiting to cross the border.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
290033,292385,"Not only people cross the border here,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
292385,295652,"but entire chunks of one city move to the next,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
295652,299546,"and when these houses are placed
on top of these steel frames,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
299546,302123,they leave the first floor to become the second,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
302123,304177,"to be in-filled with more house,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
304177,305835,with a small business.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
305835,308712,This layering of spaces and economies,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
308712,310994,is very interesting to notice.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
310994,313509,"But not only houses, also small debris",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
313509,315856,"from one city, from San Diego, to Tijuana.",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
315856,318242,Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
318242,320871,that are used in the slums to build retaining walls.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
320871,323224,But look at what people have done here in conditions,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
323224,325452,of socioeconomic emergency.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
325452,328613,"They have figured out how to peel off the tire,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
328613,330978,how to thread it and interlock it,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
330978,335106,to construct a more efficient retaining wall.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
335106,338318,Or the garage doors that are brought,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
338318,340826,from San Diego in trucks,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
340826,345555,to become the new skin of emergency housing,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
345555,347394,in many of these slums,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
347394,349724,surrounding the edges of Tijuana.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
349724,351140,"So while, as an architect,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
351140,353067,"this is a very compelling thing to witness,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
353067,354761,"this creative intelligence,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
354761,356774,I also want to keep myself in check.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
356774,358810,I don't want to romanticize poverty.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
358810,360801,I just want to suggest,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
360801,362942,that this informal urbanization,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
362942,366541,"is not just the image of precariousness,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
366541,369623,"that informality here, the informal,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
369623,374153,"is really a set of socioeconomic
and political procedures",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
374153,376862,"that we could translate as artists,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
376862,379207,that this is about a bottom-up urbanization,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
379207,380732,that performs.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
380732,383558,"See here, buildings are not important",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
383558,385521,"just for their looks,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
385521,388962,"but, in fact, they are important for what they can do.",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
388962,392061,They truly perform as they transform through time,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
392076,394224,and as communities negotiate,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
394224,397733,the spaces and boundaries and resources.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
397733,400854,"So while waste flows southbound,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
400854,403382,"people go north in search of dollars,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
403382,405917,and most of my research has had to do,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
405917,409812,with the impact of immigration,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
409812,412286,in the alteration of the homogeneity,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
412286,414612,"of many neighborhoods in the United States,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
414612,416576,particularly in San Diego.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
416576,418961,And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
418961,421614,that the future of Southern California,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
421614,424137,depends on the retrofitting,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
424137,427344,"of the large urbanization -- I mean, on steroids --",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
427344,429832,"with the small programs,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
429832,431608,social and economic.,aG-ZeDqG8Zk
431608,433713,"I'm referring to how immigrants,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk
433713,435511,"when they come to these neighborhoods,",aG-ZeDqG8Zk

288480.0,289680.0,Why is that?,pb--rJGgVIo
290440.0,294480.0,"Well, it's because mass transit
hasn't yet figured out",pb--rJGgVIo
295320.0,297960.0,how to get to everybody's doorstep.,pb--rJGgVIo
298920.0,301496.0,"And so back in San Francisco,
where I live,",pb--rJGgVIo
301520.0,302856.0,"the situation's much worse,",pb--rJGgVIo
302880.0,305480.0,"in fact, much worse around the world.",pb--rJGgVIo
306000.0,309456.0,"And so the beginning
of Uber in 2010 was --",pb--rJGgVIo
309480.0,311976.0,"well, we just wanted
to push a button and get a ride.",pb--rJGgVIo
312000.0,314296.0,We didn't have any grand ambitions.,pb--rJGgVIo
314320.0,315656.0,But it just turned out,pb--rJGgVIo
315680.0,318576.0,"that lots of people wanted
to push a button and get a ride,",pb--rJGgVIo
318600.0,323160.0,"and ultimately what we started to see
was a lot of duplicate rides.",pb--rJGgVIo
324360.0,326136.0,We saw a lot of people,pb--rJGgVIo
326160.0,329176.0,pushing the same button at the same time,pb--rJGgVIo
329200.0,331656.0,going essentially to the same place.,pb--rJGgVIo
331680.0,333256.0,"And so we started thinking about,",pb--rJGgVIo
333280.0,336960.0,"well, how do we make those two trips
and turn them into one.",pb--rJGgVIo
337840.0,341176.0,"Because if we did,
that ride would be a lot cheaper --",pb--rJGgVIo
341200.0,342680.0,up to 50 percent cheaper --,pb--rJGgVIo
343160.0,344416.0,and of course for the city,pb--rJGgVIo
344440.0,347496.0,"you've got a lot more people
and a lot fewer cars.",pb--rJGgVIo
347520.0,349896.0,And so the big question for us was:,pb--rJGgVIo
349920.0,351216.0,would it work?,pb--rJGgVIo
351240.0,354616.0,Could you have a cheaper ride,pb--rJGgVIo
354640.0,357480.0,"cheap enough that people
would be willing to share it?",pb--rJGgVIo
358360.0,361600.0,"And the answer, fortunately,
is a resounding yes.",pb--rJGgVIo
362080.0,363776.0,"In San Francisco,",pb--rJGgVIo
363800.0,366456.0,"before uberPOOL, we had --",pb--rJGgVIo
366480.0,369856.0,"well, everybody would take their car
wherever the heck they wanted.",pb--rJGgVIo
369880.0,372400.0,"And the bright colors
is where we have the most cars.",pb--rJGgVIo
372880.0,375016.0,"And once we introduced uberPOOL,",pb--rJGgVIo
375040.0,377320.0,"well, you see there's not
as many bright colors.",pb--rJGgVIo
378400.0,382336.0,"More people getting around
the city in fewer cars,",pb--rJGgVIo
382360.0,384416.0,taking cars off the road.,pb--rJGgVIo
384440.0,386360.0,It looks like uberPOOL is working.,pb--rJGgVIo
387240.0,389680.0,And so we rolled it out in Los Angeles,pb--rJGgVIo
390640.0,392040.0,eight months ago.,pb--rJGgVIo
392560.0,397600.0,"And since then, we've taken
7.9 million miles off the roads",pb--rJGgVIo
398120.0,404480.0,"and we've taken 1.4 thousand
metric tons of CO2 out of the air.",pb--rJGgVIo
405400.0,407216.0,But the part that I'm really --,pb--rJGgVIo
407240.0,409840.0,(Applause),pb--rJGgVIo
411520.0,413976.0,But my favorite statistic --,pb--rJGgVIo
414000.0,415256.0,"remember, I'm from LA,",pb--rJGgVIo
415280.0,416536.0,I spent years of my life,pb--rJGgVIo
416560.0,419896.0,"sitting behind the wheel,
going, How do we fix this?"" --""",pb--rJGgVIo
419920.0,423656.0,"my favorite part
is that eight months later,",pb--rJGgVIo
423680.0,429720.0,"we have added 100,000 new people
that are carpooling every week.",pb--rJGgVIo
430200.0,433040.0,"Now, in China everything is supersized,",pb--rJGgVIo
433720.0,438096.0,"and so we're doing 15 million
uberPOOL trips per month,",pb--rJGgVIo
438120.0,440176.0,"that's 500,000 per day.",pb--rJGgVIo
440200.0,443176.0,"And of course we're seeing
that exponential growth happen.",pb--rJGgVIo
443200.0,445296.0,"In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.",pb--rJGgVIo
445320.0,447696.0,"And when I talk to my team,
we don't talk about,",pb--rJGgVIo
447720.0,454080.0,"Hey, well, 100,000 people",pb--rJGgVIo
,,,pb--rJGgVIo
454400.0,456080.0,How do we get that to a million?,pb--rJGgVIo
456680.0,459040.0,"And in China, well,
that could be several million.",pb--rJGgVIo
459800.0,465936.0,"And so uberPOOL is a very great
solution for urban carpooling.",pb--rJGgVIo
465960.0,467896.0,But what about the suburbs?,pb--rJGgVIo
467920.0,470296.0,"This is the street
where I grew up in Los Angeles,",pb--rJGgVIo
470320.0,472836.0,"it's actually a suburb
called Northridge, California,",pb--rJGgVIo
472850.0,474136.0,"and, well --",pb--rJGgVIo
474160.0,477760.0,"look, those mailboxes,
they kind of just go on forever.",pb--rJGgVIo
478600.0,481000.0,"And every morning at about the same time,",pb--rJGgVIo
481840.0,483736.0,"cars roll of out their driveway,",pb--rJGgVIo
483760.0,486520.0,"most of them, one person in the car,",pb--rJGgVIo
487960.0,491576.0,"and they go to work,
they go to their place of work.",pb--rJGgVIo
491600.0,492856.0,So the question for us is:,pb--rJGgVIo
492880.0,494120.0,"well, how do we turn",pb--rJGgVIo
495320.0,497136.0,all of these commuter cars --,pb--rJGgVIo
497160.0,500440.0,"and literally there's
tens of millions of them --",pb--rJGgVIo
501080.0,504160.0,"how do we turn all these

17260,19260,"of about eight of my projects,",FQdQhV1yjfc
19260,22260,done in collaboration with Danish artist Soren Pors.,FQdQhV1yjfc
22260,24260,"We call ourselves Pors and Rao,",FQdQhV1yjfc
24260,26260,and we live and work in India.,FQdQhV1yjfc
26260,29260,"I'd like to begin with my very first object,",FQdQhV1yjfc
29260,31260,"which I call The Uncle Phone.""""",FQdQhV1yjfc
31260,34260,And it was inspired by my uncle's peculiar habit,FQdQhV1yjfc
34260,36260,"of constantly asking me to do things for him,",FQdQhV1yjfc
36260,38260,almost like I were an extension of his body --,FQdQhV1yjfc
38260,40260,"to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water,",FQdQhV1yjfc
40260,42260,a pack of cigarettes.,FQdQhV1yjfc
42260,44260,"And as I grew up, it became worse and worse,",FQdQhV1yjfc
44260,46260,And I started to think of it as a form of control.,FQdQhV1yjfc
46260,48260,"But of course, I could never say anything,",FQdQhV1yjfc
48260,50260,because the uncle is a respected figure,FQdQhV1yjfc
50260,52260,in the Indian family.,FQdQhV1yjfc
52260,55260,And the situation that irked me and mystified me the most,FQdQhV1yjfc
55260,57260,was his use of a landline telephone.,FQdQhV1yjfc
57260,60260,He would hold on to the receiver and expect me to dial a number for him.,FQdQhV1yjfc
60260,63260,"And so as a response and as a gift to my uncle,",FQdQhV1yjfc
63260,65260,"I made him The Uncle Phone.""""",FQdQhV1yjfc
65260,68260,It's so long that it requires two people to use it.,FQdQhV1yjfc
68260,72260,It's exactly the way my uncle uses a phone that's designed for one person.,FQdQhV1yjfc
72260,75260,"But the problem is that, when I left home and went to college,",FQdQhV1yjfc
75260,77260,I started missing his commands.,FQdQhV1yjfc
77260,79260,And so I made him a golden typewriter,FQdQhV1yjfc
79260,81260,through which he could dispense his commands,FQdQhV1yjfc
81260,84260,to nephews and nieces around the world as an email.,FQdQhV1yjfc
84260,87260,"So what he had to do was take a piece of paper, roll it into the carriage,",FQdQhV1yjfc
87260,90260,type his email or command and pull the paper out.,FQdQhV1yjfc
90260,93260,This device would automatically send the intended person,FQdQhV1yjfc
93260,95260,the letter as an email.,FQdQhV1yjfc
95260,98260,"So here you can see, we embedded a lot of electronics",FQdQhV1yjfc
98260,100260,that understands all of the mechanical actions,FQdQhV1yjfc
100260,102260,and converts it to digital.,FQdQhV1yjfc
102260,105260,So my uncle is only dealing with a mechanical interface.,FQdQhV1yjfc
105260,108260,"And of course, the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism,",FQdQhV1yjfc
108260,110260,the way my uncle likes it.,FQdQhV1yjfc
110260,113260,The next work is a sound-sensitive installation,FQdQhV1yjfc
113260,116260,"that we affectionately call The Pygmies.""""",FQdQhV1yjfc
116260,118260,And we wanted to work with a notion of being,FQdQhV1yjfc
118260,122260,"surrounded by a tribe of very shy, sensitive and sweet creatures.",FQdQhV1yjfc
122260,125260,"So how it works is we have these panels, which we have on the wall,",FQdQhV1yjfc
125260,128260,"and behind them, we have these little creatures which hide.",FQdQhV1yjfc
128260,131260,"And as soon as it's silent, they sort of creep out.",FQdQhV1yjfc
131260,133260,"And if it's even more silent, they stretch their necks out.",FQdQhV1yjfc
133260,136260,"And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.",FQdQhV1yjfc
136260,139260,So we had these panels on three walls of a room.,FQdQhV1yjfc
139260,142260,And we had over 500 of these little pygmies hiding behind them.,FQdQhV1yjfc
142260,144260,So this is how it works.,FQdQhV1yjfc
144260,146260,This is a video prototype.,FQdQhV1yjfc
146260,149260,"So when it's quiet, it's sort of coming out from behind the panels.",FQdQhV1yjfc
149260,151260,"And they hear like humans do, or real creatures do.",FQdQhV1yjfc
151260,154260,So they get immune to sounds that scare them after awhile.,FQdQhV1yjfc
154260,157260,And they don't react to background sounds.,FQdQhV1yjfc
157260,160260,You'll hear a train in moment that they don't react to.,FQdQhV1yjfc
160260,162260,(Noise),FQdQhV1yjfc
162260,165260,But they react to foreground sounds. You'll hear that in a second.,FQdQhV1yjfc
165260,168260,(Whistling),FQdQhV1yjfc
170260,172260,So we worked very hard,FQdQhV1yjfc
172260,175260,to make them as lifelike as possible.,FQdQhV1yjfc
176260,178260,"So each pygmy has its own behavior, psyche,",FQdQhV1yjfc
178260,181260,"mood swings, personalities and so on.",FQdQhV1yjfc
181260,183260,So this is a very early prototype.,FQdQhV1yjfc
183260,185260,"Of course, it got much better after that.",FQdQhV1yjfc
185260,187260,"And we made them react to people,",FQdQhV1yjfc
187260,191260,but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them.,FQdQhV1yjfc
191260,194260,"This is a video installation called The Missing Person.""""",FQdQhV1yjfc
194260,196260,And we were quite intrigued,FQdQhV1yjfc
196260,198260,with playing with the notion of invisibility.,FQdQhV1yjfc
198260,201260,How would it be possible to experience a sense of invisibility?,FQdQhV1yjfc
201260,203260,So we worked with a company,FQdQhV1yjfc
203260,205260,"that specializes in camera surveillance,",FQdQhV1yjfc
205260,208260,"and we asked them to develop a piece of software with us,",FQdQhV1yjfc
208260,210260,using a camera,FQdQhV1yjfc
210260,212260,"that could look at people in the room, track them",FQdQhV1yjfc
212260,215260,"and replace one person with the background, rendering them invisible.",FQdQhV1yjfc
215260,218260,So I'm just going to show you a very early prototype.,FQdQhV1yjfc
218260,220260,"On the right side you can see my colleague Soren,",FQdQhV1yjfc
220260,222260,who's actually in the space.,FQdQhV1yjfc
222260,224260,"And on the left side, you'll see the processed video",FQdQhV1yjfc
224260,227260,where the camera has made him invisible.,FQdQhV1yjfc
227260,230260,Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.,FQdQhV1yjfc
230260,233260,And you can see that the camera is tracking him and erasing.,FQdQhV1yjfc
233260,235260,"It's a very early video,",FQdQhV1yjfc
235260,237260,"so we haven't yet dealt with the overlap and all of that,",FQdQhV1yjfc
237260,240260,"but that got refined pretty soon, later.",FQdQhV1yjfc
240260,243260,"So how we used it was in a room where we had a camera looking into the space,",FQdQhV1yjfc
243260,246260,"and we had one monitor, one on each wall.",FQdQhV1yjfc
246260,248260,"And as people walked into the room,",FQdQhV1yjfc
248260,251260,"they would see themselves in the monitor, except with one difference:",FQdQhV1yjfc
251260,253260,one person was constantly invisible,FQdQhV1yjfc
253260,255260,wherever they moved in the room.,FQdQhV1yjfc
255260,257260,"So this is a work called The Sun Shadow.""""",FQdQhV1yjfc
257260,260260,"And it was almost like a sheet of paper,",FQdQhV1yjfc
260260,262260,like a cutout of a childlike drawing,FQdQhV1yjfc
262260,264260,of an oil spill or a sun.,FQdQhV1yjfc
264260,267260,"And from the front, this object appeared to be very strong and robust,",FQdQhV1yjfc
267260,270260,"and from the side, it almost seemed very weak.",FQdQhV1yjfc
270260,273260,"So people would walking into the room and they'd almost ignore it,",FQdQhV1yjfc
273260,275260,thinking it was some crap laying around.,FQdQhV1yjfc
275260,277260,"But as soon as they passed by,",FQdQhV1yjfc
277260,279260,it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion.,FQdQhV1yjfc
279260,282260,"And it would get exhausted, and it would collapse every time.",FQdQhV1yjfc
282260,284260,(Laughter),FQdQhV1yjfc
284260,286260,So this work,FQdQhV1yjfc
286260,288260,is a caricature of an upside-down man.,FQdQhV1yjfc
288260,290260,"His head is so heavy, full of heavy thoughts,",FQdQhV1yjfc
290260,292260,"that it's sort of fallen into his hat,",FQdQhV1yjfc
292260,294260,and his body's grown out of him almost like a plant.,FQdQhV1yjfc
294260,296260,Well what he does is he moves around,FQdQhV1yjfc
296260,298260,in a very drunken fashion on his head,FQdQhV1yjfc
298260,301260,in a very unpredictable and extremely slow movement.,FQdQhV1yjfc
301260,304260,And it's kind of constrained by that circle.,FQdQhV1yjfc
304260,307260,"Because if that circle weren't there, and the floor was very even,",FQdQhV1yjfc
307260,309260,it would start to wander about in the space.,FQdQhV1yjfc
309260,311260,And there's no wires.,FQdQhV1yjfc
311260,313260,So I'll just show you an instance --,FQdQhV1yjfc
313260,315260,"so when people enter the room, it activates this object.",FQdQhV1yjfc
315260,317260,"And it very slowly, over a few minutes,",FQdQhV1yjfc
317260,319260,"sort of painfully goes up,",FQdQhV1yjfc
319260,321260,and then it gains momentum,FQdQhV1yjfc
321260,323260,and it looks like it's almost about to fall.,FQdQhV1yjfc
323260,325260,"And this is an important moment,",FQdQhV1yjfc
325260,327260,because we wanted to instill in the viewer,FQdQhV1yjfc
327260,329260,"an instinct to almost go and help, or save the subject.",FQdQhV1yjfc
329260,331260,"But it doesn't really need it,",FQdQhV1yjfc
331260,334260,"because it, again, sort of manages to pull itself up.",FQdQhV1yjfc
334260,337260,"So this work was a real technical challenge for us,",FQdQhV1yjfc
337260,340260,"and we worked very hard, like most of our works, over years",FQdQhV1yjfc
340260,343260,to get the mechanics right and the equilibrium and the dynamics.,FQdQhV1yjfc
343260,345260,And it was very important for us,FQdQhV1yjfc
345260,348260,"to establish the exact moment that it would fall,",FQdQhV1yjfc
348260,351260,"because if we made it in a way that it would topple over,",FQdQhV1yjfc
351260,353260,"then it would damage itself,",FQdQhV1yjfc
353260,356260,"and if it didn't fall enough, it wouldn't instill that fatalism,",FQdQhV1yjfc
356260,358260,or that sense of wanting to go and help it.,FQdQhV1yjfc
358260,360260,So I'm going to show you a very quick video,FQdQhV1yjfc
360260,362260,where we are doing a test scenario -- it's much faster.,FQdQhV1yjfc
362260,364260,That's my colleague. He's let it go.,FQdQhV1yjfc
364260,366260,"Now he's getting nervous, so he's going to go catch it.",FQdQhV1yjfc
366260,368260,"But he doesn't need to,",FQdQhV1yjfc
368260,370260,because it manages to lift itself up on its own.,FQdQhV1yjfc
370260,373260,"So this is a work that we were very intrigued with,",FQdQhV1yjfc
373260,375260,working with the aesthetic of fur,FQdQhV1yjfc
375260,378260,embedded with thousands of tiny different sizes,FQdQhV1yjfc
378260,381260,"of fiber optics, which twinkle like the night sky.",FQdQhV1yjfc
381260,383260,And it's at the scale of the night sky.,FQdQhV1yjfc
383260,385260,"So we wrapped this around a blob-like form,",FQdQhV1yjfc
385260,387260,"which is in the shape of a teddy bear,",FQdQhV1yjfc
387260,389260,which was hanging from the ceiling.,FQdQhV1yjfc
389260,391260,And the idea was to sort of contrast,FQdQhV1yjfc
391260,394260,something very cold and distant and abstract like the universe,FQdQhV1yjfc
394260,396260,"into the familiar form of a teddy bear,",FQdQhV1yjfc
396260,398260,which is very comforting and intimate.,FQdQhV1yjfc
398260,400260,And the idea was that at some point,FQdQhV1yjfc
400260,402260,you would stop looking at the form of a teddy bear,FQdQhV1yjfc
402260,405260,"and you would almost perceive it to be a hole in the space,",FQdQhV1yjfc
405260,408260,and as if you were looking out into the twinkling night sky.,FQdQhV1yjfc
409260,411260,"So this is the last work, and a work in progress,",FQdQhV1yjfc
411260,413260,"and it's called Space Filler.""""",FQdQhV1yjfc
413260,415260,Well imagine a small cube that's about this big,FQdQhV1yjfc
415260,417260,"standing in front of you in the middle of the room,",FQdQhV1yjfc
417260,420260,"and as you approached it, it tried to intimidate you",FQdQhV1yjfc
420260,422260,by growing into a cube,FQdQhV1yjfc
422260,425260,that's twice its height and [eight] times its volume.,FQdQhV1yjfc
425260,428260,And so this object is constantly expanding and contracting,FQdQhV1yjfc
428260,430260,to create a dynamic with people moving around it --,FQdQhV1yjfc
430260,432260,almost like it were trying,FQdQhV1yjfc
432260,434260,to conceal a secret within its seams or something.,FQdQhV1yjfc
434260,437260,"So we work with a lot of technology,",FQdQhV1yjfc
437260,439260,"but we don't really love technology,",FQdQhV1yjfc
439260,442260,because it gives us a lot of pain in our work over years and years.,FQdQhV1yjfc
442260,444260,But we use it because we're interested,FQdQhV1yjfc
444260,446260,in the way that it can help us,FQdQhV1yjfc
446260,449260,to express the emotions and behavioral patterns,FQdQhV1yjfc
449260,451260,in these creatures that we create.,FQdQhV1yjfc
451260,453260,"And once a creature pops into our minds,",FQdQhV1yjfc
453260,455260,it's almost like the process of creation,FQdQhV1yjfc
455260,458260,is to discover the way this creature really wants to exist,FQdQhV1yjfc

103000,105000,A sense of place:,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
105000,112000,your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ

134000,139000,"it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ

144000,147000,"And when you degrade the public realm,",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
147000,150000,you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
150000,159000,and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
159000,164000,The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
164000,168000,"because we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
168000,172000,and market squares of older cultures.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
172000,180000,And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
180000,185000,all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
185000,190000,"This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
190000,195000,that we threw in the garbage after World War II,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ

212000,217000,"Where we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
217000,223000,"by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ

250000,256000,"You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
256000,260000,"And remember, to create a place of character and quality,",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
260000,262000,you have to be able to define space.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
262000,264000,So how is that being accomplished here?,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
264000,267000,If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
267000,269000,"and try to look at the Target store over here,",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
269000,275000,you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter),Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
275000,281000,That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
281000,284000,"Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
284000,288000,These will be places that are not worth caring about.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
288000,291000,"We have about, you know, 38,000 places",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ

312000,316000,I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ

322000,324000,We need better places in this country.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
325000,327000,Public space. This is a good public space.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
327000,330000,It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
330000,333000,It is emphatically an outdoor public room.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
333000,336000,It has something that is terribly important --,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
336000,339000,it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
339000,344000,"That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations --",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
344000,347000,things go in and out of it. It's permeable.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
347000,350000,"The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
350000,355000,and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
355000,359000,"You know, in these places in other cultures,",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
359000,363000,people just go there voluntarily because they like them.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ

369000,373000,People just go because it's pleasurable to be there.,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ

758000,761000,to see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter),Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
763000,768000,A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma,Q1ZeXnmDZMQ

772000,774000,"city life, and everything connected with it.",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ
774000,779000,"And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,",Q1ZeXnmDZMQ

15330,18330,I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here,scITIoJvMJ0

21330,24330,"about how we should think about cancer differently,",scITIoJvMJ0

26330,29330,who know a lot more about cancer than I do.,scITIoJvMJ0
30330,33330,But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be,scITIoJvMJ0
33330,35330,because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.,scITIoJvMJ0
35330,37330,(Laughter),scITIoJvMJ0
37330,39330,"And that this, in fact, will be",scITIoJvMJ0
39330,42330,the way that we treat cancer in the future.,scITIoJvMJ0
43330,45330,"In order to talk about cancer,",scITIoJvMJ0
45330,48330,I'm going to actually have to --,scITIoJvMJ0
48330,51330,let me get the big slide here.,scITIoJvMJ0
53330,56330,"First, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics.",scITIoJvMJ0
56330,58330,I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture,scITIoJvMJ0
58330,61330,of all the other things that are going on --,scITIoJvMJ0
61330,64330,"and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics.",scITIoJvMJ0
64330,66330,"Having explained those,",scITIoJvMJ0
66330,69330,that will set up for what I think will be a different idea,scITIoJvMJ0
69330,71330,about how to go about treating cancer.,scITIoJvMJ0
71330,73330,So let me start with genomics.,scITIoJvMJ0
73330,75330,It is the hot topic.,scITIoJvMJ0
75330,77330,It is the place where we're learning the most.,scITIoJvMJ0
77330,79330,This is the great frontier.,scITIoJvMJ0
79330,82330,But it has its limitations.,scITIoJvMJ0
82330,85330,"And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy",scITIoJvMJ0
85330,88330,"that the genome is like the blueprint of your body,",scITIoJvMJ0
88330,90330,"and if that were only true, it would be great,",scITIoJvMJ0
90330,92330,but it's not.,scITIoJvMJ0
92330,94330,It's like the parts list of your body.,scITIoJvMJ0
94330,96330,"It doesn't say how things are connected,",scITIoJvMJ0
96330,99330,what causes what and so on.,scITIoJvMJ0
99330,101330,"So if I can make an analogy,",scITIoJvMJ0
101330,103330,let's say that you were trying to tell the difference,scITIoJvMJ0
103330,106330,"between a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant",scITIoJvMJ0
106330,108330,"and a sick restaurant,",scITIoJvMJ0
108330,110330,and all you had was the list of ingredients,scITIoJvMJ0
110330,113330,that they had in their larder.,scITIoJvMJ0
113330,116330,"So it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant",scITIoJvMJ0
116330,118330,and you looked through it and you found,scITIoJvMJ0
118330,120330,"they only had margarine and they didn't have butter,",scITIoJvMJ0
120330,122330,"you could say, Ah, I see what's wrong with them.""",scITIoJvMJ0
122330,124330,"I can make them healthy.""
44;124330;126330;And there probably are special cases of that.""",scITIoJvMJ0
126330,128330,You could certainly tell the difference,scITIoJvMJ0
128330,130330,between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant,scITIoJvMJ0
130330,132330,by what they had in a larder.,scITIoJvMJ0
132330,135330,"So the list of ingredients does tell you something,",scITIoJvMJ0
135330,138330,and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.,scITIoJvMJ0
139330,141330,"If they have tons of salt,",scITIoJvMJ0
141330,144330,"you might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that.",scITIoJvMJ0
144330,146330,"But it's limited,",scITIoJvMJ0
146330,148330,"because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant,",scITIoJvMJ0
148330,151330,"you need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen,",scITIoJvMJ0
151330,154330,you need the product of all of those ingredients.,scITIoJvMJ0
154330,156330,So if I look at a person,scITIoJvMJ0
156330,159330,"and I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing.",scITIoJvMJ0
159330,161330,The part of the genome that we can read,scITIoJvMJ0
161330,163330,is the list of ingredients.,scITIoJvMJ0
163330,165330,"And so indeed,",scITIoJvMJ0
165330,167330,there are times when we can find ingredients,scITIoJvMJ0
167330,169330,that [are] bad.,scITIoJvMJ0
169330,171330,Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease,scITIoJvMJ0
171330,174330,"where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease,",scITIoJvMJ0
174330,177330,and we can actually make a direct correspondence,scITIoJvMJ0
177330,180330,between the ingredient and the disease.,scITIoJvMJ0
180330,183330,"But most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen,",scITIoJvMJ0
183330,185330,"because, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people --",scITIoJvMJ0
185330,187330,they have the same genome.,scITIoJvMJ0
187330,189330,So the genome really tells you much more,scITIoJvMJ0
189330,191330,about predisposition.,scITIoJvMJ0
191330,193330,So what you can tell,scITIoJvMJ0
193330,195330,is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person,scITIoJvMJ0
195330,197330,by looking at their ingredients list.,scITIoJvMJ0
197330,200330,But you really for the most part can't tell the difference,scITIoJvMJ0
200330,203330,between a healthy person and a sick person --,scITIoJvMJ0
203330,205330,except in some of these special cases.,scITIoJvMJ0
205330,207330,So why all the big deal,scITIoJvMJ0
207330,209330,about genetics?,scITIoJvMJ0
209330,211330,"Well first of all,",scITIoJvMJ0
211330,214330,"it's because we can read it, which is fantastic.",scITIoJvMJ0
214330,217330,It is very useful in certain circumstances.,scITIoJvMJ0
217330,220330,It's also the great theoretical triumph,scITIoJvMJ0
220330,222330,of biology.,scITIoJvMJ0
222330,224330,It's the one theory,scITIoJvMJ0
224330,226330,that the biologists ever really got right.,scITIoJvMJ0
226330,228330,It's fundamental to Darwin,scITIoJvMJ0
228330,230330,and Mendel and so on.,scITIoJvMJ0
230330,233330,And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.,scITIoJvMJ0
234330,236330,So Mendel had this idea of a gene,scITIoJvMJ0
236330,239330,"as an abstract thing,",scITIoJvMJ0
239330,241330,and Darwin built a whole theory,scITIoJvMJ0
241330,243330,"that depended on them existing,",scITIoJvMJ0
243330,245330,and then Watson and Crick,scITIoJvMJ0
245330,247330,actually looked and found one.,scITIoJvMJ0
247330,249330,So this happens in physics all the time.,scITIoJvMJ0
249330,251330,"You predict a black hole,",scITIoJvMJ0
251330,254330,"and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.",scITIoJvMJ0
254330,256330,But it rarely happens in biology.,scITIoJvMJ0
256330,259330,"So this great triumph -- it's so good,",scITIoJvMJ0
259330,261330,there's almost a religious experience,scITIoJvMJ0
261330,263330,in biology.,scITIoJvMJ0
263330,265330,And Darwinian evolution,scITIoJvMJ0
265330,268330,is really the core theory.,scITIoJvMJ0
270330,272330,So the other reason it's been very popular,scITIoJvMJ0
272330,275330,"is because we can measure it, it's digital.",scITIoJvMJ0
275330,277330,"And in fact,",scITIoJvMJ0
277330,279330,"thanks to Kary Mullis,",scITIoJvMJ0
279330,283330,you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen,scITIoJvMJ0
283330,286330,with a few extra ingredients.,scITIoJvMJ0
286330,289330,"So for instance, by measuring the genome,",scITIoJvMJ0
289330,293330,we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals,scITIoJvMJ0
293330,296330,"by the closeness of our genome,",scITIoJvMJ0
296330,299330,"or how we're related to each other -- the family tree,",scITIoJvMJ0
299330,301330,or the tree of life.,scITIoJvMJ0
301330,304330,There's a huge amount of information about the genetics,scITIoJvMJ0
304330,307330,just by comparing the genetic similarity.,scITIoJvMJ0
307330,309330,"Now of course, in medical application,",scITIoJvMJ0
309330,311330,that is very useful,scITIoJvMJ0
311330,314330,because it's the same kind of information,scITIoJvMJ0
314330,317330,that the doctor gets from your family medical history --,scITIoJvMJ0
317330,319330,"except probably,",scITIoJvMJ0
319330,322330,your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do.,scITIoJvMJ0
322330,324330,"And so by reading the genome,",scITIoJvMJ0
324330,327330,we can find out much more about your family than you probably know.,scITIoJvMJ0
327330,329330,And so we can discover things,scITIoJvMJ0
329330,331330,that probably you could have found,scITIoJvMJ0
331330,333330,"by looking at enough of your relatives,",scITIoJvMJ0
333330,336330,but they may be surprising.,scITIoJvMJ0
336330,338330,I did the 23andMe thing,scITIoJvMJ0
338330,341330,and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald.,scITIoJvMJ0
341330,348330,(Laughter),scITIoJvMJ0
348330,351330,But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that.,scITIoJvMJ0
351330,354330,But mostly,scITIoJvMJ0
354330,356330,"what you need to know, to find out if you're sick,",scITIoJvMJ0
356330,358330,"is not your predispositions,",scITIoJvMJ0
358330,361330,but it's actually what's going on in your body right now.,scITIoJvMJ0
361330,363330,"So to do that, what you really need to do,",scITIoJvMJ0
363330,365330,you need to look at the things,scITIoJvMJ0
365330,367330,that the genes are producing,scITIoJvMJ0
367330,369330,"and what's happening after the genetics,",scITIoJvMJ0
369330,371330,and that's what proteomics is about.,scITIoJvMJ0
371330,374330,"Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes,",scITIoJvMJ0
374330,377330,proteomics is the study of all the proteins.,scITIoJvMJ0
377330,379330,And the proteins are all of the little things in your body,scITIoJvMJ0
379330,382330,that are signaling between the cells --,scITIoJvMJ0
382330,384330,"actually, the machines that are operating --",scITIoJvMJ0
384330,386330,that's where the action is.,scITIoJvMJ0
386330,389330,"Basically, a human body",scITIoJvMJ0
389330,392330,"is a conversation going on,",scITIoJvMJ0
392330,395330,"both within the cells and between the cells,",scITIoJvMJ0
395330,398330,"and they're telling each other to grow and to die,",scITIoJvMJ0
398330,400330,"and when you're sick,",scITIoJvMJ0
400330,402330,something's gone wrong with that conversation.,scITIoJvMJ0
402330,404330,And so the trick is --,scITIoJvMJ0
404330,407330,"unfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these",scITIoJvMJ0
407330,409330,like we can measure the genome.,scITIoJvMJ0
409330,412330,So the problem is that measuring --,scITIoJvMJ0
412330,415330,"if you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process.",scITIoJvMJ0
415330,417330,"It requires hundreds of steps,",scITIoJvMJ0
417330,419330,"and it takes a long, long time.",scITIoJvMJ0
419330,421330,And it matters how much of the protein it is.,scITIoJvMJ0
421330,424330,"It could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent,",scITIoJvMJ0
424330,427330,so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA.,scITIoJvMJ0
427330,429330,And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle,scITIoJvMJ0
429330,431330,"of this very long stage,",scITIoJvMJ0
431330,433330,"they pause for just a moment,",scITIoJvMJ0
433330,435330,"and they leave something in an enzyme for a second,",scITIoJvMJ0
435330,437330,and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on,scITIoJvMJ0
437330,439330,don't work.,scITIoJvMJ0
439330,441330,And so then people get very inconsistent results,scITIoJvMJ0
441330,443330,when they do it this way.,scITIoJvMJ0
443330,445330,People have tried very hard to do this.,scITIoJvMJ0
445330,447330,I tried this a couple of times,scITIoJvMJ0
447330,449330,and looked at this problem and gave up on it.,scITIoJvMJ0
449330,451330,I kept getting this call from this oncologist,scITIoJvMJ0
451330,453330,named David Agus.,scITIoJvMJ0
453330,456330,And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls,scITIoJvMJ0
456330,458330,"from people who want help with their problems,",scITIoJvMJ0
458330,461330,"and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back,",scITIoJvMJ0
461330,464330,so I kept on giving him to the delay list.,scITIoJvMJ0
464330,466330,"And then one day,",scITIoJvMJ0
466330,468330,"I get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman",scITIoJvMJ0
468330,470330,and Al Gore on the same day,scITIoJvMJ0
470330,472330,saying return David Agus's phone call.,scITIoJvMJ0
472330,474330,(Laughter),scITIoJvMJ0
474330,476330,"So I was like, Okay. This guy's at least resourceful.""""",scITIoJvMJ0
476330,480330,(Laughter),scITIoJvMJ0
480330,482330,"So we started talking,",scITIoJvMJ0
482330,485330,"and he said, I really need a better way to measure proteins.""""",scITIoJvMJ0
485330,487330,"I'm like, Looked at that. Been there.""",scITIoJvMJ0
487330,489330,"Not going to be easy.""
193;489330;491330;He's like, ""No, no. I really need it.""",scITIoJvMJ0
491330,495330,"I mean, I see patients dying every day",scITIoJvMJ0
495330,498330,because we don't know what's going on inside of them.,scITIoJvMJ0
498330,500330,"We have to have a window into this.""
197;500330;502330;And he took me through""",scITIoJvMJ0
502330,505330,specific examples of when he really needed it.,scITIoJvMJ0
505330,507330,"And I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference,",scITIoJvMJ0
507330,509330,"if we could do it,",scITIoJvMJ0
509330,511330,"and so I said, Well, let's look at it.""""",scITIoJvMJ0
511330,513330,Applied Minds has enough play money,scITIoJvMJ0
513330,515330,that we can go and just work on something,scITIoJvMJ0
515330,518330,without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything.,scITIoJvMJ0
518330,520330,So we started playing around with this.,scITIoJvMJ0
520330,523330,"And as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem --",scITIoJvMJ0
523330,525330,that taking the sip of coffee --,scITIoJvMJ0
525330,527330,that there were humans doing this complicated process,scITIoJvMJ0
527330,529330,and that what really needed to be done,scITIoJvMJ0
529330,532330,was to automate this process like an assembly line,scITIoJvMJ0
532330,534330,and build robots,scITIoJvMJ0
534330,536330,that would measure proteomics.,scITIoJvMJ0
536330,538330,"And so we did that,",scITIoJvMJ0
538330,540330,"and working with David,",scITIoJvMJ0
540330,543330,"we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually,",scITIoJvMJ0
543330,546330,"which makes this robotic assembly line,",scITIoJvMJ0
546330,549330,"which, in a very consistent way, measures the protein.",scITIoJvMJ0
549330,552330,And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like.,scITIoJvMJ0
553330,555330,"Basically, what we do",scITIoJvMJ0
555330,557330,is we take a drop of blood,scITIoJvMJ0
557330,559330,"out of a patient,",scITIoJvMJ0
559330,561330,and we sort out the proteins,scITIoJvMJ0
561330,563330,in the drop of blood,scITIoJvMJ0
563330,565330,"according to how much they weigh,",scITIoJvMJ0
565330,567330,"how slippery they are,",scITIoJvMJ0
567330,570330,and we arrange them in an image.,scITIoJvMJ0
570330,572330,And so we can look at literally,scITIoJvMJ0
572330,574330,hundreds of thousands of features at once,scITIoJvMJ0
574330,576330,out of that drop of blood.,scITIoJvMJ0
576330,578330,"And we can take a different one tomorrow,",scITIoJvMJ0
578330,580330,and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different --,scITIoJvMJ0
580330,583330,they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep.,scITIoJvMJ0
583330,586330,They really tell us what's going on there.,scITIoJvMJ0
586330,588330,"And so this picture,",scITIoJvMJ0
588330,590330,"which looks like a big smudge to you,",scITIoJvMJ0
590330,594330,is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this,scITIoJvMJ0
594330,596330,and made me feel like we were on the right track.,scITIoJvMJ0
596330,598330,"So if I zoom into that picture,",scITIoJvMJ0
598330,600330,I can just show you what it means.,scITIoJvMJ0
600330,603330,We sort out the proteins -- from left to right,scITIoJvMJ0
603330,606330,"is the weight of the fragments that we're getting,",scITIoJvMJ0
606330,609330,and from top to bottom is how slippery they are.,scITIoJvMJ0
609330,612330,So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it.,scITIoJvMJ0
612330,614330,And so each of these lines,scITIoJvMJ0
614330,617330,represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein.,scITIoJvMJ0
617330,619330,And you can see how the lines occur,scITIoJvMJ0
619330,623330,"in these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.",scITIoJvMJ0
623330,626330,And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that --,scITIoJvMJ0
626330,628330,"carbon comes in different isotopes,",scITIoJvMJ0
628330,631330,"so if it has an extra neutron on it,",scITIoJvMJ0
631330,635330,we actually measure it as a different chemical.,scITIoJvMJ0
635330,638330,So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one.,scITIoJvMJ0
638330,641330,And so that gives you an idea,scITIoJvMJ0
641330,643330,of how exquisitely sensitive this is.,scITIoJvMJ0
643330,645330,So seeing this picture,scITIoJvMJ0
645330,647330,is sort of like getting to be Galileo,scITIoJvMJ0
647330,649330,and looking at the stars,scITIoJvMJ0
649330,651330,"and looking through the telescope for the first time,",scITIoJvMJ0
651330,654330,"and suddenly you say, Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was.""""",scITIoJvMJ0
654330,656330,But we can see that stuff out there,scITIoJvMJ0
656330,658330,and actually see features of it.,scITIoJvMJ0
658330,661330,So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns.,scITIoJvMJ0
661330,663330,So what we do with this,scITIoJvMJ0
663330,665330,"is, for example, we can look at two patients,",scITIoJvMJ0
665330,668330,"one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug,",scITIoJvMJ0
668330,670330,"and ask, What's going on differently""",scITIoJvMJ0
670330,672330,"inside of them?""
268;672330;675330;And so we can make these measurements precisely enough""",scITIoJvMJ0
675330,678330,that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences.,scITIoJvMJ0
678330,680330,So here we have Alice in green,scITIoJvMJ0
680330,682330,and Bob in red.,scITIoJvMJ0
682330,685330,We overlay them. This is actual data.,scITIoJvMJ0
685330,688330,"And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow,",scITIoJvMJ0
688330,690330,but there's some things that just Alice has,scITIoJvMJ0
690330,692330,and some things that just Bob has.,scITIoJvMJ0
692330,695330,And if we find a pattern of things,scITIoJvMJ0
695330,698330,"of the responders to the drug,",scITIoJvMJ0
698330,700330,"we see that in the blood,",scITIoJvMJ0
700330,702330,they have the condition,scITIoJvMJ0
702330,704330,that allows them to respond to this drug.,scITIoJvMJ0
704330,706330,"We might not even know what this protein is,",scITIoJvMJ0
706330,708330,but we can see it's a marker,scITIoJvMJ0
708330,710330,for the response to the disease.,scITIoJvMJ0
713330,715330,"So this already, I think,",scITIoJvMJ0
715330,718330,is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.,scITIoJvMJ0
718330,720330,But I think this is actually,scITIoJvMJ0
720330,722330,just the beginning,scITIoJvMJ0
722330,724330,of how we're going to treat cancer.,scITIoJvMJ0
724330,726330,So let me move to cancer.,scITIoJvMJ0
726330,728330,The thing about cancer --,scITIoJvMJ0
728330,730330,"when I got into this,",scITIoJvMJ0
730330,732330,"I really knew nothing about it,",scITIoJvMJ0
732330,734330,"but working with David Agus,",scITIoJvMJ0
734330,737330,I started watching how cancer was actually being treated,scITIoJvMJ0
737330,740330,and went to operations where it was being cut out.,scITIoJvMJ0
740330,742330,"And as I looked at it,",scITIoJvMJ0
742330,744330,to me it didn't make sense,scITIoJvMJ0
744330,746330,"how we were approaching cancer,",scITIoJvMJ0
746330,749330,"and in order to make sense of it,",scITIoJvMJ0
749330,752330,I had to learn where did this come from.,scITIoJvMJ0
752330,756330,We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease.,scITIoJvMJ0
756330,758330,We're treating it as something that got inside of you,scITIoJvMJ0
758330,760330,that we have to kill.,scITIoJvMJ0
760330,762330,So this is the great paradigm.,scITIoJvMJ0
762330,764330,This is another case,scITIoJvMJ0
764330,766330,where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked --,scITIoJvMJ0
766330,769330,was the germ theory of disease.,scITIoJvMJ0
769330,771330,So what doctors are mostly trained to do,scITIoJvMJ0
771330,773330,is diagnose --,scITIoJvMJ0
773330,775330,"that is, put you into a category",scITIoJvMJ0
775330,777330,and apply a scientifically proven treatment,scITIoJvMJ0
777330,779330,for that diagnosis --,scITIoJvMJ0
779330,782330,and that works great for infectious diseases.,scITIoJvMJ0
782330,784330,So if we put you in the category,scITIoJvMJ0
784330,787330,"of you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin.",scITIoJvMJ0
787330,789330,We know that that works.,scITIoJvMJ0
789330,791330,"If you've got malaria, we give you quinine",scITIoJvMJ0
791330,793330,or some derivative of it.,scITIoJvMJ0
793330,796330,"And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do,",scITIoJvMJ0
796330,798330,and it's miraculous,scITIoJvMJ0
798330,801330,in the case of infectious disease --,scITIoJvMJ0
801330,803330,how well it works.,scITIoJvMJ0
803330,806330,And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive,scITIoJvMJ0
806330,808330,if doctors didn't do this.,scITIoJvMJ0
808330,810330,But now let's apply that,scITIoJvMJ0
810330,812330,to systems diseases like cancer.,scITIoJvMJ0
812330,814330,"The problem is that, in cancer,",scITIoJvMJ0
814330,816330,there isn't something else,scITIoJvMJ0
816330,818330,that's inside of you.,scITIoJvMJ0
818330,820330,It's you; you're broken.,scITIoJvMJ0
820330,824330,That conversation inside of you,scITIoJvMJ0
824330,826330,got mixed up in some way.,scITIoJvMJ0
826330,828330,So how do we diagnose that conversation?,scITIoJvMJ0
828330,831330,"Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body --",scITIoJvMJ0
831330,834330,"you know, where did it appear? --",scITIoJvMJ0
834330,836330,and we put you in different categories,scITIoJvMJ0
836330,838330,according to the part of the body.,scITIoJvMJ0
838330,840330,And then we do a clinical trial,scITIoJvMJ0
840330,842330,for a drug for lung cancer,scITIoJvMJ0
842330,845330,"and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer,",scITIoJvMJ0
845330,848330,and we treat these as if they're separate diseases,scITIoJvMJ0
848330,850330,and that this way of dividing them,scITIoJvMJ0
850330,852330,had something to do with what actually went wrong.,scITIoJvMJ0
852330,854330,"And of course, it really doesn't have that much to do",scITIoJvMJ0
854330,856330,with what went wrong,scITIoJvMJ0
856330,859330,because cancer is a failure of the system.,scITIoJvMJ0
859330,861330,"And in fact, I think we're even wrong",scITIoJvMJ0
861330,864330,when we talk about cancer as a thing.,scITIoJvMJ0
864330,866330,I think this is the big mistake.,scITIoJvMJ0
866330,870330,I think cancer should not be a noun.,scITIoJvMJ0
870330,872330,We should talk about cancering,scITIoJvMJ0
872330,875330,"as something we do, not something we have.",scITIoJvMJ0
875330,877330,"And so those tumors,",scITIoJvMJ0
877330,879330,those are symptoms of cancer.,scITIoJvMJ0
879330,882330,"And so your body is probably cancering all the time,",scITIoJvMJ0
882330,885330,but there are lots of systems in your body,scITIoJvMJ0
885330,887330,that keep it under control.,scITIoJvMJ0
887330,889330,And so to give you an idea,scITIoJvMJ0
889330,891330,of an analogy of what I mean,scITIoJvMJ0
891330,894330,"by thinking of cancering as a verb,",scITIoJvMJ0

897330,899330,"and the way that we talked about it,",scITIoJvMJ0
899330,902330,we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen,scITIoJvMJ0

906330,909330,"We might divide it -- the plumber would say, Well, where's the water?""""",scITIoJvMJ0
909330,912330,"Well, it's in the kitchen."" ""Oh, you must have kitchen water.""""",scITIoJvMJ0

917330,919330,"well, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it.",scITIoJvMJ0

922330,925330,that helps.,scITIoJvMJ0
925330,927330,"Whereas living room water,",scITIoJvMJ0
927330,929330,"it's better to do tar on the roof.""
374;929330;931330;And it sounds silly,""",scITIoJvMJ0
931330,933330,but that's basically what we do.,scITIoJvMJ0
933330,936330,"And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer,",scITIoJvMJ0
936330,939330,but I'm saying that's not really the problem;,scITIoJvMJ0
939330,941330,that's the symptom of the problem.,scITIoJvMJ0
941330,943330,What we really need to get at,scITIoJvMJ0
943330,945330,"is the process that's going on,",scITIoJvMJ0
945330,947330,and that's happening at the level,scITIoJvMJ0
947330,949330,"of the proteonomic actions,",scITIoJvMJ0
949330,952330,happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself,scITIoJvMJ0
952330,954330,in the way that it normally does?,scITIoJvMJ0
954330,957330,"Because normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time.",scITIoJvMJ0
957330,960330,"So your house is dealing with leaks all the time,",scITIoJvMJ0
960330,964330,but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on.,scITIoJvMJ0
964330,967330,So what we need,scITIoJvMJ0
967330,971330,is to have a causative model,scITIoJvMJ0
971330,973330,"of what's actually going on,",scITIoJvMJ0
973330,976330,and proteomics actually gives us,scITIoJvMJ0
976330,979330,the ability to build a model like that.,scITIoJvMJ0
979330,981330,David got me invited,scITIoJvMJ0
981330,983330,to give a talk at National Cancer Institute,scITIoJvMJ0
983330,986330,and Anna Barker was there.,scITIoJvMJ0
987330,989330,And so I gave this talk,scITIoJvMJ0
989330,992330,"and said, Why don't you guys do this?""""",scITIoJvMJ0
992330,994330,"And Anna said,",scITIoJvMJ0
994330,997330,"Because nobody within cancer""",scITIoJvMJ0
997330,999330,would look at it this way.,scITIoJvMJ0
999330,1002330,"But what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program",scITIoJvMJ0
1002330,1004330,for people outside the field of cancer,scITIoJvMJ0
1004330,1006330,to get together with doctors,scITIoJvMJ0

1009330,1013330,"and work out different programs of research.""
406;1013330;1015330;So David and I applied to this program""",scITIoJvMJ0
1015330,1017330,and created a consortium,scITIoJvMJ0
1017330,1019330,at USC,scITIoJvMJ0
1019330,1022330,where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world,scITIoJvMJ0
1022330,1025330,"and some of the best biologists in the world,",scITIoJvMJ0
1025330,1027330,"from Cold Spring Harbor,",scITIoJvMJ0
1027330,1029330,"Stanford, Austin --",scITIoJvMJ0
1029330,1032330,I won't even go through and name all the places --,scITIoJvMJ0
1032330,1035330,to have a research project,scITIoJvMJ0
1035330,1037330,that will last for five years,scITIoJvMJ0
1037330,1040330,where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this.,scITIoJvMJ0
1040330,1042330,"We're doing it in mice first,",scITIoJvMJ0
1042330,1044330,and we will kill a lot of mice,scITIoJvMJ0
1044330,1046330,"in the process of doing this,",scITIoJvMJ0
1046330,1048330,but they will die for a good cause.,scITIoJvMJ0
1048330,1051330,And we will actually try to get to the point,scITIoJvMJ0
1051330,1053330,where we have a predictive model,scITIoJvMJ0
1053330,1055330,"where we can understand,",scITIoJvMJ0
1055330,1057330,"when cancer happens,",scITIoJvMJ0
1057330,1059330,what's actually happening in there,scITIoJvMJ0
1059330,1062330,and which treatment will treat that cancer.,scITIoJvMJ0
1062330,1065330,So let me just end with giving you a little picture,scITIoJvMJ0
1065330,1068330,of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future.,scITIoJvMJ0
1068330,1070330,"So I think eventually,",scITIoJvMJ0
1070330,1072330,"once we have one of these models for people,",scITIoJvMJ0
1072330,1074330,which we'll get eventually --,scITIoJvMJ0
1074330,1076330,"I mean, our group won't get all the way there --",scITIoJvMJ0
1076330,1079330,but eventually we'll have a very good computer model --,scITIoJvMJ0
1079330,1082330,sort of like a global climate model for weather.,scITIoJvMJ0
1082330,1085330,It has lots of different information,scITIoJvMJ0
1085330,1088330,about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation,scITIoJvMJ0
1088330,1090330,on many different scales.,scITIoJvMJ0
1090330,1092330,And so we will simulate,scITIoJvMJ0
1092330,1094330,in that model,scITIoJvMJ0
1094330,1097330,for your particular cancer --,scITIoJvMJ0
1097330,1099330,"and this also will be for ALS,",scITIoJvMJ0
1099330,1102330,"or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases,",scITIoJvMJ0
1102330,1104330,things like that --,scITIoJvMJ0
1104330,1106330,we will simulate,scITIoJvMJ0
1106330,1108330,"specifically you,",scITIoJvMJ0
1108330,1110330,"not just a generic person,",scITIoJvMJ0
1110330,1112330,but what's actually going on inside you.,scITIoJvMJ0
1112330,1114330,"And in that simulation, what we could do",scITIoJvMJ0
1114330,1116330,is design for you specifically,scITIoJvMJ0
1116330,1118330,"a sequence of treatments,",scITIoJvMJ0
1118330,1121330,"and it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs.",scITIoJvMJ0
1121330,1124330,"It might be things like, don't eat that day,",scITIoJvMJ0
1124330,1126330,"or give them a little chemotherapy,",scITIoJvMJ0
1126330,1128330,maybe a little radiation.,scITIoJvMJ0
1128330,1131330,"Of course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on.",scITIoJvMJ0
1131330,1134330,But design a program of treatments specifically for you,scITIoJvMJ0
1134330,1137330,and help your body,scITIoJvMJ0
1137330,1140330,guide back to health --,scITIoJvMJ0
1140330,1142330,guide your body back to health.,scITIoJvMJ0
1142330,1146330,Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it,scITIoJvMJ0
1146330,1149330,if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong.,scITIoJvMJ0
1149330,1151330,We put it in the equivalent of splints.,scITIoJvMJ0
1151330,1153330,And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms,scITIoJvMJ0
1153330,1155330,"for fixing cancer,",scITIoJvMJ0
1155330,1158330,and we just have to prop those up in the right way,scITIoJvMJ0
1158330,1160330,and get them to do the job.,scITIoJvMJ0
1160330,1162330,And so I believe that this will be the way,scITIoJvMJ0
1162330,1164330,that cancer will be treated in the future.,scITIoJvMJ0
1164330,1166330,"It's going to require a lot of work,",scITIoJvMJ0
1166330,1168330,a lot of research.,scITIoJvMJ0
1168330,1171330,There will be many teams like our team,scITIoJvMJ0
1171330,1173330,that work on this.,scITIoJvMJ0
1173330,1175330,"But I think eventually,",scITIoJvMJ0
1175330,1177330,we will design for everybody,scITIoJvMJ0
1177330,1181330,a custom treatment for cancer.,scITIoJvMJ0

18330,20330,Today I want to talk to you about,HALd9FY5-VQ
20330,23330,"swimming across the North Pole,",HALd9FY5-VQ
23330,25330,across the most northern place in the whole world.,HALd9FY5-VQ
25330,29330,And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.,HALd9FY5-VQ
29330,31330,He was a great storyteller.,HALd9FY5-VQ
31330,34330,"He could tell a story about an event,",HALd9FY5-VQ
34330,37330,and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.,HALd9FY5-VQ
37330,40330,And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy,HALd9FY5-VQ
40330,44330,was of the first British atomic bomb test.,HALd9FY5-VQ
44330,48330,He had been there and watched it go off.,HALd9FY5-VQ
48330,51330,And he said that the explosion was so loud,HALd9FY5-VQ
51330,53330,"and the light was so intense,",HALd9FY5-VQ
53330,57330,that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes.,HALd9FY5-VQ
57330,60330,And he said that he could actually see an x-ray,HALd9FY5-VQ
60330,62330,"of his fingers,",HALd9FY5-VQ
62330,65330,because the light was so bright.,HALd9FY5-VQ
65330,69330,And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off,HALd9FY5-VQ
69330,72330,"had a very, very big impact on my late father.",HALd9FY5-VQ
72330,75330,Every holiday I had as a young boy,HALd9FY5-VQ
75330,77330,was in a national park.,HALd9FY5-VQ
77330,79330,What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me,HALd9FY5-VQ
79330,81330,"to protect the world,",HALd9FY5-VQ
81330,85330,and show me just how fragile the world is.,HALd9FY5-VQ
85330,88330,He also told me about the great explorers.,HALd9FY5-VQ
88330,91330,He loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott,HALd9FY5-VQ
91330,93330,walking all the way to the South Pole,HALd9FY5-VQ
93330,96330,and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest.,HALd9FY5-VQ
96330,99330,"And so ever since I think I was just six years old,",HALd9FY5-VQ
99330,101330,I dreamed of going to the polar regions.,HALd9FY5-VQ
101330,104330,"I really, really wanted to go to the Arctic.",HALd9FY5-VQ
104330,106330,There was something about that place,HALd9FY5-VQ
106330,108330,which drew me to it.,HALd9FY5-VQ
108330,111330,"And, well, sometimes it takes a long time",HALd9FY5-VQ
111330,113330,for a dream to come true.,HALd9FY5-VQ
113330,116330,"But seven years ago, I went to the Arctic",HALd9FY5-VQ
116330,118330,for the first time.,HALd9FY5-VQ
118330,121330,And it was so beautiful that I've been back there,HALd9FY5-VQ
121330,123330,"ever since, for the last seven years.",HALd9FY5-VQ
123330,125330,I love the place.,HALd9FY5-VQ
125330,128330,But I have seen that place change,HALd9FY5-VQ
128330,130330,"beyond all description,",HALd9FY5-VQ
130330,132330,just in that short period of time.,HALd9FY5-VQ
132330,135330,"I have seen polar bears walking across very, very thin ice",HALd9FY5-VQ
135330,137330,in search of food.,HALd9FY5-VQ
137330,140330,I have swum in front of glaciers,HALd9FY5-VQ
140330,142330,which have retreated so much.,HALd9FY5-VQ
142330,144330,"And I have also, every year,",HALd9FY5-VQ
144330,147330,seen less and less sea ice.,HALd9FY5-VQ
147330,150330,And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there.,HALd9FY5-VQ
150330,153330,"In the two years before my swim,",HALd9FY5-VQ
153330,156330,23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover,HALd9FY5-VQ
156330,158330,just melted away.,HALd9FY5-VQ
158330,161330,And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders,HALd9FY5-VQ
161330,165330,to get them to understand what is happening.,HALd9FY5-VQ
165330,167330,So I decided to do this symbolic swim,HALd9FY5-VQ
167330,171330,"at the top of the world, in a place which should be frozen over,",HALd9FY5-VQ
171330,174330,but which now is rapidly unfreezing.,HALd9FY5-VQ
174330,176330,And the message was very clear:,HALd9FY5-VQ
176330,178330,"Climate change is for real,",HALd9FY5-VQ
178330,180330,and we need to do something about it.,HALd9FY5-VQ
180330,184330,And we need to do something about it right now.,HALd9FY5-VQ
184330,187330,"Well, swimming across the North Pole,",HALd9FY5-VQ
187330,190330,it's not an ordinary thing to do.,HALd9FY5-VQ
190330,192330,"I mean, just to put it in perspective,",HALd9FY5-VQ
192330,196330,27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool.,HALd9FY5-VQ
196330,201330,"This morning, the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees.",HALd9FY5-VQ
201330,204330,The passengers who fell off the Titanic,HALd9FY5-VQ
204330,207330,fell into water of just five degrees centigrade.,HALd9FY5-VQ
207330,210330,Fresh water freezes at zero.,HALd9FY5-VQ
210330,214330,And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7.,HALd9FY5-VQ
214330,216330,It's fucking freezing.,HALd9FY5-VQ
216330,218330,(Laughter),HALd9FY5-VQ
218330,221330,(Applause),HALd9FY5-VQ
221330,224330,"I'm sorry, but there is no other way to describe it.",HALd9FY5-VQ
224330,228330,(Laughter),HALd9FY5-VQ
228330,232330,And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me,HALd9FY5-VQ
232330,234330,to help me with this task.,HALd9FY5-VQ
234330,241330,I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations.,HALd9FY5-VQ
241330,244330,"Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport,",HALd9FY5-VQ
244330,246330,you just dive into the sea and off you go.,HALd9FY5-VQ
246330,249330,It couldn't be further from the truth for me.,HALd9FY5-VQ
249330,252330,"And I then went and did a huge amount of training,",HALd9FY5-VQ
252330,255330,"swimming in icy water, backwards and forwards.",HALd9FY5-VQ
255330,258330,But the most important thing was to train my mind,HALd9FY5-VQ
258330,260330,to prepare myself for what was going to happen.,HALd9FY5-VQ
260330,262330,And I had to visualize the swim.,HALd9FY5-VQ
262330,265330,I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.,HALd9FY5-VQ
265330,267330,I had to taste the salt water in my mouth.,HALd9FY5-VQ
267330,269330,"I had to see my coach screaming for me,",HALd9FY5-VQ
269330,273330,"Come on Lewis! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Don't slow down!""""",HALd9FY5-VQ
273330,276330,And so I literally swam across the North Pole,HALd9FY5-VQ
276330,280330,hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind.,HALd9FY5-VQ
280330,283330,"And then, after a year of training, I felt ready.",HALd9FY5-VQ
283330,285330,I felt confident that I could actually,HALd9FY5-VQ
285330,287330,do this swim.,HALd9FY5-VQ
287330,289330,"So myself and the five members of the team,",HALd9FY5-VQ
289330,291330,we hitched a ride on an icebreaker,HALd9FY5-VQ
291330,293330,which was going to the North Pole.,HALd9FY5-VQ
293330,296330,"And on day four, we decided to just do a quick",HALd9FY5-VQ
296330,298330,five minute test swim.,HALd9FY5-VQ
298330,302330,"I had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before,",HALd9FY5-VQ
302330,304330,because it's just impossible to train,HALd9FY5-VQ
304330,306330,in those types of conditions.,HALd9FY5-VQ
306330,308330,"So we stopped the ship, as you do.",HALd9FY5-VQ
308330,310330,"We all got down onto the ice,",HALd9FY5-VQ
310330,312330,and I then got into my swimming costume,HALd9FY5-VQ
312330,315330,and I dived into the sea.,HALd9FY5-VQ
315330,318330,I have never in my life felt anything,HALd9FY5-VQ
318330,320330,like that moment.,HALd9FY5-VQ
320330,322330,I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air.,HALd9FY5-VQ
322330,325330,"I was hyperventilating so much,",HALd9FY5-VQ
325330,327330,and within seconds my hands were numb.,HALd9FY5-VQ
327330,329330,And it was -- the paradox is,HALd9FY5-VQ
329330,331330,"that you're in freezing cold water,",HALd9FY5-VQ
331330,333330,but actually you're on fire.,HALd9FY5-VQ
333330,335330,I swam as hard as I could for five minutes.,HALd9FY5-VQ
335330,337330,I remember just trying to get out of the water.,HALd9FY5-VQ
337330,339330,I climbed out of the ice.,HALd9FY5-VQ
339330,342330,And I remember taking the goggles off my face,HALd9FY5-VQ
342330,345330,"and looking down at my hands in sheer shock,",HALd9FY5-VQ
345330,348330,because my fingers,HALd9FY5-VQ
348330,351330,had swollen so much that they were like sausages.,HALd9FY5-VQ
351330,356330,"And they were swollen so much, I couldn't even close them.",HALd9FY5-VQ
356330,359330,"What had happened is that we are made partially of water,",HALd9FY5-VQ
359330,362330,and when water freezes it expands.,HALd9FY5-VQ
362330,364330,And so what had actually happened is,HALd9FY5-VQ
364330,368330,that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded.,HALd9FY5-VQ
368330,372330,And they had burst. And I was in so much agony.,HALd9FY5-VQ
372330,375330,I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower.,HALd9FY5-VQ
375330,378330,And I remember standing underneath the hot shower,HALd9FY5-VQ
378330,382330,and trying to defrost my fingers.,HALd9FY5-VQ
382330,388330,"And I thought, in two days' time, I was going to do this swim across the North Pole.",HALd9FY5-VQ
388330,392330,"I was going to try and do a 20-minute swim,",HALd9FY5-VQ
392330,394330,for one kilometer across the North Pole.,HALd9FY5-VQ
394330,397330,And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy,HALd9FY5-VQ
397330,400330,"with my father, was just going out the window.",HALd9FY5-VQ
400330,405330,There is no possibility that this was going to happen.,HALd9FY5-VQ
405330,407330,And I remember then getting out of the shower,HALd9FY5-VQ
407330,411330,and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.,HALd9FY5-VQ
411330,414330,"And for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands",HALd9FY5-VQ
414330,417330,because you need to be able to grab the water,HALd9FY5-VQ
417330,419330,and pull it through with you.,HALd9FY5-VQ
419330,421330,"The next morning, I woke up",HALd9FY5-VQ
421330,425330,"and I was in such a state of depression,",HALd9FY5-VQ
425330,428330,and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes.,HALd9FY5-VQ
428330,431330,"For those of you who don't know him, he's the great British explorer.",HALd9FY5-VQ
431330,436330,"A number of years ago, he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole.",HALd9FY5-VQ
436330,439330,He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea.,HALd9FY5-VQ
439330,442330,"And after just three minutes in that water,",HALd9FY5-VQ
442330,444330,he was able,HALd9FY5-VQ
444330,446330,to get himself out.,HALd9FY5-VQ
446330,448330,And his hands were so badly frostbitten,HALd9FY5-VQ
448330,450330,that he had to return to England.,HALd9FY5-VQ
450330,453330,"He went to a local hospital and there they said,",HALd9FY5-VQ

158;461330;466330;And Ran decided to go into his tool shed""",HALd9FY5-VQ

479330,483330,what on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes?,HALd9FY5-VQ

303911,306123,"ES: The best way to understand PRISM,",yVwAodrjZMY
306123,307584,"because there's been a little bit of controversy,",yVwAodrjZMY

311335,314090,"Much of the debate in the U.S.
has been about metadata.",yVwAodrjZMY
314090,316981,"They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,",yVwAodrjZMY
316981,319722,and they're talking about a specific legal authority,yVwAodrjZMY
319722,322427,called Section 215 of the Patriot Act.,yVwAodrjZMY
322427,325496,"That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,",yVwAodrjZMY

342689,344733,"compel corporate America,",yVwAodrjZMY

357655,360312,"challenged them in court, they all lost,",yVwAodrjZMY
360312,363227,because it was never tried by an open court.,yVwAodrjZMY
363227,366358,They were only tried by a secret court.,yVwAodrjZMY
366358,367725,"And something that we've seen,",yVwAodrjZMY
367725,370429,"something about the PRISM program
that's very concerning to me is,",yVwAodrjZMY
370429,372408,there's been a talking point in the U.S. government,yVwAodrjZMY
372408,376159,where they've said 15 federal judges,yVwAodrjZMY
376159,378857,"have reviewed these programs

425194,430298,How was that data collected by the NSA?,yVwAodrjZMY

433477,436277,refer to it as direct access.,yVwAodrjZMY

444606,446688,"things like that, in Hawaii,",yVwAodrjZMY
446688,448657,is the provenance of that data,yVwAodrjZMY
448657,450913,is directly from their servers.,yVwAodrjZMY
450913,452977,It doesn't mean,yVwAodrjZMY
452977,455783,that there's a group of company representatives,yVwAodrjZMY
455783,458220,sitting in a smoky room with the NSA,yVwAodrjZMY
458220,460010,palling around and making back-room deals,yVwAodrjZMY
460010,462553,about how they're going to give this stuff away.,yVwAodrjZMY

466122,468213,Some are somewhat less responsible.,yVwAodrjZMY

469981,473360,"how this information is given,",yVwAodrjZMY
473360,475846,it's coming from the companies themselves.,yVwAodrjZMY
475846,478141,It's not stolen from the lines.,yVwAodrjZMY
478141,480073,But there's an important thing to remember here:,yVwAodrjZMY
480073,482004,"even though companies pushed back,",yVwAodrjZMY
482004,484057,"even though companies demanded,",yVwAodrjZMY
484057,486603,"hey, let's do this through a warrant process,",yVwAodrjZMY
486603,488377,let's do this,yVwAodrjZMY
488377,491526,"where we actually have some sort of legal review,",yVwAodrjZMY

493357,495297,"these users' data,",yVwAodrjZMY
495297,497688,we saw stories in the Washington Post last year,yVwAodrjZMY
497688,500900,that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story,yVwAodrjZMY
500900,503499,that said the NSA broke in,yVwAodrjZMY

166543,168279,"we discovered this recipe,",ClfBxWPkBKU

through an autopsy process.",ClfBxWPkBKU

227851,231515,of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis --,ClfBxWPkBKU
231515,234348,appraisal fraud and liar's loans --,ClfBxWPkBKU
234348,235793,and what we're going to see,ClfBxWPkBKU
235793,238140,in looking at both of these is,ClfBxWPkBKU
238140,241393,we got warnings that were incredibly early,ClfBxWPkBKU
241393,243362,about these frauds.,ClfBxWPkBKU
243362,247500,"We got warnings that we could
have taken advantage of easily,",ClfBxWPkBKU
247500,249970,"because back in the savings and loan debacle,",ClfBxWPkBKU
249970,252590,we had figured out how to respond,ClfBxWPkBKU
252590,254668,and prevent these crises.,ClfBxWPkBKU
254668,257972,"And three, the warnings were unambiguous.",ClfBxWPkBKU
257972,260541,They were obvious that what was going on,ClfBxWPkBKU
260541,265420,was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up.,ClfBxWPkBKU
265420,267193,Let's take appraisal fraud first.,ClfBxWPkBKU
267193,269901,This is simply where you inflate the value,ClfBxWPkBKU
269901,272630,of the home that is being pledged,ClfBxWPkBKU
272630,275227,as security for the loan.,ClfBxWPkBKU
275227,278733,"In 2000, the year 2000,",ClfBxWPkBKU
278733,283067,"that is over a year before Enron fails, by the way,",ClfBxWPkBKU
283067,287303,the honest appraisers got together a formal petition,ClfBxWPkBKU
287303,290405,"begging the federal government to act,",ClfBxWPkBKU
290405,292260,"and the industry to act,",ClfBxWPkBKU
292260,296069,to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud.,ClfBxWPkBKU
296069,299373,"And the appraisers explained how it was occurring,",ClfBxWPkBKU
299373,303010,that banks were demanding that appraisers,ClfBxWPkBKU
303010,304920,"inflate the appraisal,",ClfBxWPkBKU
304920,308221,"and that if the appraisers refused to do so,",ClfBxWPkBKU
308221,312077,"they, the banks, would blacklist",ClfBxWPkBKU
312077,314299,honest appraisers,ClfBxWPkBKU
314299,316851,and refuse to use them.,ClfBxWPkBKU
316851,319413,"Now, we've seen this before",ClfBxWPkBKU
319413,320941,"in the savings and loan debacle,",ClfBxWPkBKU
320941,322765,and we know that this kind of fraud,ClfBxWPkBKU
322765,325361,"can only originate from the lenders,",ClfBxWPkBKU
325361,328405,and that no honest lender would ever inflate,ClfBxWPkBKU
328405,329714,"the appraisal,",ClfBxWPkBKU
329714,332810,because it's the great protection against loss.,ClfBxWPkBKU
332810,336441,"So this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.",ClfBxWPkBKU
336441,338622,"It was something we'd seen before,",ClfBxWPkBKU
338622,340861,and it was completely unambiguous.,ClfBxWPkBKU
340861,344253,This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud,ClfBxWPkBKU
344253,345850,led by the banks.,ClfBxWPkBKU
345850,347523,What about liar's loans?,ClfBxWPkBKU
347523,351372,"Well, that warning actually comes earlier.",ClfBxWPkBKU
351372,354001,The savings and loan debacle is basically,ClfBxWPkBKU
354001,357548,"the early 1980s through 1993,",ClfBxWPkBKU
357548,360303,and in the midst of fighting that wave,ClfBxWPkBKU
360303,362970,"of accounting control fraud,",ClfBxWPkBKU
362970,367158,"in 1990, we found that a second front",ClfBxWPkBKU
367158,369203,of fraud was being started.,ClfBxWPkBKU
369203,371358,"And like all good financial frauds in America,",ClfBxWPkBKU
371358,375210,"it began in Orange County, California.",ClfBxWPkBKU
375210,378221,And we happened to be the regional regulators for it.,ClfBxWPkBKU
378221,380010,"And our examiners said,",ClfBxWPkBKU
380010,383365,they are making loans without even checking,ClfBxWPkBKU
383365,385868,what the borrower's income is.,ClfBxWPkBKU
385868,390451,"This is insane, it has to lead to massive losses,",ClfBxWPkBKU
390451,394083,and it only makes sense for entities engaged,ClfBxWPkBKU
394083,396324,in these accounting control frauds.,ClfBxWPkBKU
396324,398595,"And we said, yeah, you're absolutely right,",ClfBxWPkBKU
398595,401893,and we drove those liar's loans,ClfBxWPkBKU
401893,406337,"out of the industry in 1990 and 1991,",ClfBxWPkBKU
406337,408389,but we could only deal with the industry,ClfBxWPkBKU
408389,410438,"we had jurisdiction over,",ClfBxWPkBKU
410438,412143,"which was savings and loans,",ClfBxWPkBKU
412143,415523,"and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds,",ClfBxWPkBKU
415523,418429,"Long Beach Savings, voluntarily gave up",ClfBxWPkBKU
418429,421298,"its federal savings and loan charter,",ClfBxWPkBKU
421298,423741,"gave up federal deposit insurance,",ClfBxWPkBKU
423741,426000,converted to become a mortgage bank,ClfBxWPkBKU
426000,429200,"for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction,",ClfBxWPkBKU
429200,431773,"and changed its name to Ameriquest,",ClfBxWPkBKU
431773,433445,and became the most notorious,ClfBxWPkBKU
433445,437070,"of the liar's loans frauds early on,",ClfBxWPkBKU
437070,438606,"and to add to that,",ClfBxWPkBKU
438606,443826,they deliberately predated upon minorities.,ClfBxWPkBKU
443826,447917,So we knew again about this crisis.,ClfBxWPkBKU
447917,451151,We'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before.,ClfBxWPkBKU
451151,454341,"We had incredibly early warnings of it,",ClfBxWPkBKU
454341,456193,and it was absolutely unambiguous,ClfBxWPkBKU
456193,460399,"that no honest lender would
make loans in this fashion.",ClfBxWPkBKU
460399,463241,So let's take a look at the reaction,ClfBxWPkBKU
463241,466187,of the industry and the regulators,ClfBxWPkBKU
466187,468990,and the prosecutors to these clear,ClfBxWPkBKU
468990,473457,early warnings that could have prevented the crisis.,ClfBxWPkBKU
473457,475306,Start with the industry.,ClfBxWPkBKU
475306,481260,The industry responded between 2003 and 2006,ClfBxWPkBKU
481260,484101,by increasing liar's loans,ClfBxWPkBKU
484101,489333,by over 500 percent.,ClfBxWPkBKU
489333,491228,These were the loans,ClfBxWPkBKU
491228,492983,that hyperinflated the bubble,ClfBxWPkBKU
492983,496631,and produced the economic crisis.,ClfBxWPkBKU
496631,501482,"By 2006, half of all the loans called subprime",ClfBxWPkBKU
501482,503508,were also liar's loans.,ClfBxWPkBKU
503508,506793,"They're not mutually exclusive, it's just that together,",ClfBxWPkBKU
506793,509233,they're the most toxic combination,ClfBxWPkBKU
509233,511093,you can possibly imagine.,ClfBxWPkBKU
511093,514847,"By 2006, 40 percent of all the loans",ClfBxWPkBKU
514847,517464,"made that year, all the home loans made that year,",ClfBxWPkBKU
517464,520186,"were liar's loans,",ClfBxWPkBKU
520186,521497,40 percent.,ClfBxWPkBKU
521497,524201,And this is despite a warning,ClfBxWPkBKU
524201,527624,from the industry's own antifraud experts,ClfBxWPkBKU
527624,530779,that said that these loans were an open invitation,ClfBxWPkBKU
530779,532739,"to fraudsters,",ClfBxWPkBKU
532739,534481,and that they had a fraud incidence,ClfBxWPkBKU
534481,536969,"of 90 percent,",ClfBxWPkBKU
536969,539661,nine zero.,ClfBxWPkBKU
539661,542728,"In response to that, the industry",ClfBxWPkBKU
542728,547776,"first started calling these loans liar's loans,",ClfBxWPkBKU
547776,551345,"which lacks a certain subtlety,",ClfBxWPkBKU
551345,554395,"and second, massively increased them,",ClfBxWPkBKU
554395,557656,and no government regulator ever,ClfBxWPkBKU
557656,561346,required or encouraged any lender,ClfBxWPkBKU
561346,562642,to make a liar's loan,ClfBxWPkBKU
562642,565329,"or anyone to purchase a liar's loan,",ClfBxWPkBKU
565329,568499,and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie.,ClfBxWPkBKU
568499,570621,This came from the lenders,ClfBxWPkBKU
570621,573790,because of the fraud recipe.,ClfBxWPkBKU
573790,576224,What happened to appraisal fraud?,ClfBxWPkBKU
576224,579360,It expanded remarkably as well.,ClfBxWPkBKU
579360,583757,"By 2007, when a survey of appraisers was done,",ClfBxWPkBKU
583757,586458,90 percent of appraisers reported,ClfBxWPkBKU
586458,588898,that they had been subject to coercion,ClfBxWPkBKU
588898,591390,from the lenders trying to get them,ClfBxWPkBKU
591390,592960,to inflate an appraisal.,ClfBxWPkBKU
592960,595950,"In other words, both forms of fraud",ClfBxWPkBKU
595950,599724,"became absolutely endemic and normal,",ClfBxWPkBKU
599724,601953,and this is what drove the bubble.,ClfBxWPkBKU
601953,604145,What happened in the governmental sector?,ClfBxWPkBKU
604145,606749,"Well, the government, as I told you,",ClfBxWPkBKU
606749,609465,"when we were the savings and loan regulators,",ClfBxWPkBKU
609465,612143,"we could only deal with our industry,",ClfBxWPkBKU
612143,614581,"and if people gave up their
federal deposit insurance,",ClfBxWPkBKU
614581,616844,we couldn't do anything to them.,ClfBxWPkBKU
616844,620173,"Congress, it may strike you as impossible,",ClfBxWPkBKU
620173,623421,"but actually did something intelligent in 1994,",ClfBxWPkBKU
623421,626974,"and passed the Home Ownership
and Equity Protection Act",ClfBxWPkBKU
626974,630227,"that gave the Fed, and only the Federal Reserve,",ClfBxWPkBKU
630227,634254,"the explicit, statutory authority to ban liar's loans",ClfBxWPkBKU
634254,636360,"by every lender,",ClfBxWPkBKU
636360,639358,whether or not they had federal deposit insurance.,ClfBxWPkBKU
639358,642893,"So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan,",ClfBxWPkBKU
642893,644860,"as chairs of the Fed, do",ClfBxWPkBKU
644860,646766,when they got these warnings,ClfBxWPkBKU
646766,649776,that these were massively fraudulent loans,ClfBxWPkBKU
649776,653130,"and that they were being sold
to the secondary market?",ClfBxWPkBKU
653130,655350,"Remember, there's no fraud exorcist.",ClfBxWPkBKU
655350,657398,"Once it starts out a fraudulent loan,",ClfBxWPkBKU
657398,659710,it can only be sold to the secondary market,ClfBxWPkBKU
659710,660906,"through more frauds,",ClfBxWPkBKU
660906,663454,"lying about the reps and warrantees,",ClfBxWPkBKU
663454,665062,and then those people are going to produce,ClfBxWPkBKU
665062,666490,mortgage-backed securities,ClfBxWPkBKU
666490,667758,and exotic derivatives,ClfBxWPkBKU
667758,670980,which are also going to be supposedly backed,ClfBxWPkBKU
670980,672703,by those fraudulent loans.,ClfBxWPkBKU
672703,674244,So the fraud is going to progress,ClfBxWPkBKU
674244,675708,"through the entire system,",ClfBxWPkBKU
675708,678961,"hyperinflate the bubble, produce a disaster.",ClfBxWPkBKU
678961,682262,"And remember, we had experience with this.",ClfBxWPkBKU
682262,684550,"We had seen significant losses,",ClfBxWPkBKU
684550,687996,and we had experience of competent regulators,ClfBxWPkBKU
687996,689486,in stopping it.,ClfBxWPkBKU
689486,692382,Greenspan and Bernanke refused,ClfBxWPkBKU
692382,694793,to use the authority under the statute,ClfBxWPkBKU
694793,697110,to stop liar's loans.,ClfBxWPkBKU
697110,699674,And this was a matter first of dogma.,ClfBxWPkBKU
699674,702525,They're just horrifically opposed,ClfBxWPkBKU
702525,704344,to anything regulatory.,ClfBxWPkBKU
704344,709060,"But it is also the international competition in laxity,",ClfBxWPkBKU
709060,710344,the race to the bottom,ClfBxWPkBKU
710344,714379,"between the United States and the United Kingdom,",ClfBxWPkBKU
714379,715980,"the city of London, in particular,",ClfBxWPkBKU
715980,718950,"and the city of London won that race to the bottom,",ClfBxWPkBKU
718950,722802,but it meant that all regulation in the West,ClfBxWPkBKU
722802,724806,was completely degraded,ClfBxWPkBKU
724806,726890,in this stupid competition to be,ClfBxWPkBKU
726890,728962,who could have the weakest regulation.,ClfBxWPkBKU
728962,731012,So that was the regulatory response.,ClfBxWPkBKU
731012,734669,What about the response of the prosecutors,ClfBxWPkBKU
734669,736404,"after the crisis,",ClfBxWPkBKU
736404,740602,"after 11 trillion dollars in losses,",ClfBxWPkBKU
740602,742642,"after 10 million jobs lost,",ClfBxWPkBKU
742642,745926,a crisis in which the losses and the frauds,ClfBxWPkBKU
745926,749381,were more than 70 times larger,ClfBxWPkBKU
749381,751685,than the savings and loan debacle?,ClfBxWPkBKU
751685,753576,"Well, in the savings and loan debacle,",ClfBxWPkBKU
753576,757546,"our agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS,",ClfBxWPkBKU
757546,761630,"made over 30,000 criminal referrals,",ClfBxWPkBKU
761630,764266,"produced over 1,000 felony convictions",ClfBxWPkBKU
764266,766940,"just in cases designated as major,",ClfBxWPkBKU
766940,770078,"and that understates the degree of prioritization,",ClfBxWPkBKU
770078,771874,because we worked with the FBI,ClfBxWPkBKU
771874,776138,"to create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,",ClfBxWPkBKU
776138,779402,"the absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.",ClfBxWPkBKU
779402,782186,"Roughly 300 savings and loans involved,",ClfBxWPkBKU
782186,785500,roughly 600 senior officials.,ClfBxWPkBKU
785500,787840,Virtually all of them were prosecuted.,ClfBxWPkBKU
787840,790671,We had a 90 percent conviction rate.,ClfBxWPkBKU
790671,792501,It's the greatest success against,ClfBxWPkBKU
792501,795103,"elite white collar criminals ever,",ClfBxWPkBKU
795103,797339,and it was because of this understanding,ClfBxWPkBKU
797339,798674,of control fraud,ClfBxWPkBKU
798674,801185,and the accounting control fraud mechanism.,ClfBxWPkBKU
801185,804357,Flash forward to the current crisis.,ClfBxWPkBKU
804357,806930,"The same agency, Office of Thrift Supervision,",ClfBxWPkBKU

833494,835449,The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,ClfBxWPkBKU

850872,852804,It isn't simply that they've had,ClfBxWPkBKU
852804,854626,to reinvent the wheel,ClfBxWPkBKU
854626,856544,of how to do these prosecutions;,ClfBxWPkBKU

875459,877696,"With no expertise coming from the regulators,",ClfBxWPkBKU
877696,880787,the FBI formed what it calls a partnership,ClfBxWPkBKU

957890,960800,"And so, while lions are roaming the campsite,",ClfBxWPkBKU
960800,964010,the FBI is chasing mice.,ClfBxWPkBKU
964010,965440,What do we need to do?,ClfBxWPkBKU
965440,967944,What can we do in all of this?,ClfBxWPkBKU
967944,971763,We need to change the perverse incentive structures,ClfBxWPkBKU
971763,974759,that produce these recurrent epidemics,ClfBxWPkBKU
974759,976088,of accounting control fraud,ClfBxWPkBKU
976088,978102,that are driving our crises.,ClfBxWPkBKU
978102,980990,So we have to first get rid,ClfBxWPkBKU
980990,983478,of the systemically dangerous institutions.,ClfBxWPkBKU
983478,986963,These are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions.,ClfBxWPkBKU
986963,989105,"We need to shrink them to the point,",ClfBxWPkBKU
989105,990700,"within the next five years,",ClfBxWPkBKU
990700,993435,that they no longer pose a systemic risk.,ClfBxWPkBKU
993435,995572,"Right now, they are ticking time bombs",ClfBxWPkBKU
995572,998915,that will cause a global crisis,ClfBxWPkBKU
998915,1001264,as soon as the next one fails --,ClfBxWPkBKU
1001264,1003060,"not if, when.",ClfBxWPkBKU
1003060,1005971,Second thing we need to do is completely reform,ClfBxWPkBKU
1005971,1008963,"modern executive and professional compensation,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1008963,1013306,which is what they use to suborn the appraisers.,ClfBxWPkBKU
1013306,1015194,"Remember, they were pressuring the appraisers",ClfBxWPkBKU
1015194,1016976,"through the compensation system,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1016976,1019638,"trying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1019638,1022217,in which bad ethics drives good ethics,ClfBxWPkBKU
1022217,1023583,out of the marketplace.,ClfBxWPkBKU
1023583,1025519,"And they largely succeeded,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1025519,1028402,which is how the fraud became endemic.,ClfBxWPkBKU
1028402,1031100,And the third thing that we need to do,ClfBxWPkBKU
1031100,1033738,is deal with what we call the three D's:,ClfBxWPkBKU
1033738,1036319,"deregulation, desupervision,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1036319,1040340,and the de facto decriminalization.,ClfBxWPkBKU
1040340,1042437,Because we can make,ClfBxWPkBKU
1042437,1046111,"all three of these changes, and if we do so,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1046111,1048920,we can dramatically reduce,ClfBxWPkBKU
1048920,1051112,how often we have a crisis,ClfBxWPkBKU
1051112,1054739,and how severe those crises are.,ClfBxWPkBKU
1054739,1057720,That is not simply critical to our economy.,ClfBxWPkBKU
1057720,1061146,You can see what these crises do to inequality,ClfBxWPkBKU
1061146,1063466,and what they do to our democracy.,ClfBxWPkBKU
1063466,1066210,"They have produced crony capitalism,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1066210,1067592,"American-style,",ClfBxWPkBKU

1080409,1085694,"70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1085694,1088548,we have no meaningful reforms,ClfBxWPkBKU
1088548,1091922,"in any of the three areas that I've talked about,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1091922,1093714,"other than banning liar's loans,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1093714,1094790,"which is good,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1094790,1097214,but that's just one form of ammunition,ClfBxWPkBKU
1097214,1098610,for this fraud weapon.,ClfBxWPkBKU
1098610,1102591,There are many forms of ammunition they can use.,ClfBxWPkBKU
1102591,1104342,That's why we need to learn,ClfBxWPkBKU
1104342,1106454,what the bankers have learned:,ClfBxWPkBKU
1106454,1109877,"the recipe for the best way to rob a bank,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1109877,1112742,"so that we can stop that recipe,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1112742,1114504,"because our legislators,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1114504,1117194,"who are dependent on political contributions,",ClfBxWPkBKU
1117194,1119388,will not do it on their own.,ClfBxWPkBKU

12843,15434,"In 2007, I became the attorney general",ZJNESMhIxQ0
15434,17159,of the state of New Jersey.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
17159,19439,"Before that, I'd been a criminal prosecutor,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
19439,22120,"first in the Manhattan district attorney's office,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
22120,24770,and then at the United States Department of Justice.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
24770,26971,"But when I became the attorney general,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
26971,30866,"two things happened that changed
the way I see criminal justice.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
30866,32896,The first is that I asked what I thought,ZJNESMhIxQ0
32896,35082,were really basic questions.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
35082,37938,"I wanted to understand who we were arresting,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
37938,39602,"who we were charging,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
39602,41730,and who we were putting in our nation's jails,ZJNESMhIxQ0
41730,43146,and prisons.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
43146,44794,I also wanted to understand,ZJNESMhIxQ0
44794,46123,if we were making decisions,ZJNESMhIxQ0
46123,48641,in a way that made us safer.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
48641,51893,And I couldn't get this information out.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
51893,55250,It turned out that most big criminal justice agencies,ZJNESMhIxQ0
55250,56552,like my own,ZJNESMhIxQ0
56552,58934,didn't track the things that matter.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
58934,62252,"So after about a month of being incredibly frustrated,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
62252,64223,I walked down into a conference room,ZJNESMhIxQ0
64223,66113,that was filled with detectives,ZJNESMhIxQ0
66113,68895,"and stacks and stacks of case files,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
68895,70071,and the detectives were sitting there,ZJNESMhIxQ0
70071,72305,with yellow legal pads taking notes.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
72305,73891,They were trying to get the information,ZJNESMhIxQ0
73891,75109,I was looking for,ZJNESMhIxQ0
75109,77154,by going through case by case,ZJNESMhIxQ0
77154,79052,for the past five years.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
79052,80705,"And as you can imagine,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
80705,83348,"when we finally got the results, they weren't good.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
83348,85003,It turned out that we were doing,ZJNESMhIxQ0
85003,87023,a lot of low-level drug cases,ZJNESMhIxQ0
87023,88498,on the streets just around the corner,ZJNESMhIxQ0
88498,90766,from our office in Trenton.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
90766,92233,The second thing that happened,ZJNESMhIxQ0
92233,95907,"is that I spent the day in the Camden,
New Jersey police department.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
95907,97794,"Now, at that time, Camden, New Jersey,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
97794,100446,was the most dangerous city in America.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
100446,104273,"I ran the Camden Police
Department because of that.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
104273,106385,"I spent the day in the police department,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
106385,109111,"and I was taken into a room
with senior police officials,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
109111,110786,all of whom were working hard,ZJNESMhIxQ0
110786,114043,and trying very hard to reduce crime in Camden.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
114043,115869,"And what I saw in that room,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
115869,118114,"as we talked about how to reduce crime,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
118114,121973,"were a series of officers with a
lot of little yellow sticky notes.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
121973,124819,"And they would take a yellow sticky
and they would write something on it",ZJNESMhIxQ0
124823,126622,and they would put it up on a board.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
126622,128793,"And one of them said,
We had a robbery two weeks ago.""",ZJNESMhIxQ0
128793,130504,"We have no suspects.""
53;130504;135531;And another said, ""We had a shooting in this neighborhood last week. We have no suspects.""""",ZJNESMhIxQ0
135531,138114,We weren't using data-driven policing.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
138114,140156,We were essentially trying to fight crime,ZJNESMhIxQ0
140156,142683,with yellow Post-it notes.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
142683,144818,"Now, both of these things made me realize",ZJNESMhIxQ0
144818,148069,fundamentally that we were failing.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
148069,151192,"We didn't even know who was
in our criminal justice system,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
151192,154427,"we didn't have any data about
the things that mattered,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
154427,156995,and we didn't share data or use analytics,ZJNESMhIxQ0
156995,159146,or tools to help us make better decisions,ZJNESMhIxQ0
159146,161149,and to reduce crime.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
161149,163373,"And for the first time, I started to think",ZJNESMhIxQ0
163373,165283,about how we made decisions.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
165283,166680,"When I was an assistant D.A.,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
166680,168550,"and when I was a federal prosecutor,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
168550,170296,"I looked at the cases in front of me,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
170296,172922,and I generally made decisions based on my instinct,ZJNESMhIxQ0
172922,174614,and my experience.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
174614,176273,"When I became attorney general,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
176273,177912,"I could look at the system as a whole,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
177912,179730,and what surprised me is that I found,ZJNESMhIxQ0
179730,181635,that that was exactly how we were doing it,ZJNESMhIxQ0
181635,183938,across the entire system --,ZJNESMhIxQ0
183938,186339,"in police departments, in prosecutors's offices,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
186339,189139,in courts and in jails.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
189139,191336,And what I learned very quickly,ZJNESMhIxQ0
191336,194969,is that we weren't doing a good job.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
194969,196985,So I wanted to do things differently.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
196985,199182,I wanted to introduce data and analytics,ZJNESMhIxQ0
199182,201231,and rigorous statistical analysis,ZJNESMhIxQ0
201231,202631,into our work.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
202631,205601,"In short, I wanted to moneyball criminal justice.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
205601,207628,"Now, moneyball, as many of you know,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
207628,209197,"is what the Oakland A's did,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
209197,211170,where they used smart data and statistics,ZJNESMhIxQ0
211170,212792,to figure out how to pick players,ZJNESMhIxQ0
212792,214313,"that would help them win games,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
214313,217293,"and they went from a system that
was based on baseball scouts",ZJNESMhIxQ0
217293,219153,who used to go out and watch players,ZJNESMhIxQ0
219153,220790,"and use their instinct and experience,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
220790,222533,"the scouts' instincts and experience,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
222533,224246,"to pick players, from one to use",ZJNESMhIxQ0
224246,227068,smart data and rigorous statistical analysis,ZJNESMhIxQ0
227068,230439,"to figure out how to pick players
that would help them win games.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
230439,232237,"It worked for the Oakland A's,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
232237,234456,and it worked in the state of New Jersey.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
234456,236529,We took Camden off the top of the list,ZJNESMhIxQ0
236529,238700,as the most dangerous city in America.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
238700,241855,"We reduced murders there by 41 percent,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
241855,244837,which actually means 37 lives were saved.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
244837,248577,And we reduced all crime in the city by 26 percent.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
248577,251816,"We also changed the way
we did criminal prosecutions.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
251816,253821,So we went from doing low-level drug crimes,ZJNESMhIxQ0
253821,255463,that were outside our building,ZJNESMhIxQ0
255463,257805,"to doing cases of statewide importance,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
257805,260963,"on things like reducing violence
with the most violent offenders,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
260963,262821,"prosecuting street gangs,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
262821,266229,"gun and drug trafficking, and political corruption.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
266229,268731,"And all of this matters greatly,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
268731,270676,because public safety to me,ZJNESMhIxQ0
270676,273212,is the most important function of government.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
273212,275510,"If we're not safe, we can't be educated,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
275510,276858,"we can't be healthy,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
276858,279803,"we can't do any of the other things
we want to do in our lives.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
279803,281504,And we live in a country today,ZJNESMhIxQ0
281504,284638,where we face serious criminal justice problems.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
284638,288299,We have 12 million arrests every single year.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
288299,290342,The vast majority of those arrests,ZJNESMhIxQ0
290342,293354,"are for low-level crimes, like misdemeanors,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
293354,295088,70 to 80 percent.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
295088,297079,Less than five percent of all arrests,ZJNESMhIxQ0
297079,298974,are for violent crime.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
298974,301029,"Yet we spend 75 billion,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
301029,302447,"that's b for billion,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
302447,306574,dollars a year on state and local corrections costs.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
306574,309415,"Right now, today, we have 2.3 million people",ZJNESMhIxQ0
309415,311315,in our jails and prisons.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
311315,314111,And we face unbelievable public safety challenges,ZJNESMhIxQ0
314111,316050,because we have a situation,ZJNESMhIxQ0
316050,318948,in which two thirds of the people in our jails,ZJNESMhIxQ0
318948,320702,are there waiting for trial.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
320702,322837,They haven't yet been convicted of a crime.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
322837,324956,They're just waiting for their day in court.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
324956,328504,And 67 percent of people come back.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
328504,331532,"Our recidivism rate is amongst
the highest in the world.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
331532,333635,Almost seven in 10 people who are released,ZJNESMhIxQ0
333635,335286,from prison will be rearrested,ZJNESMhIxQ0
335286,339241,in a constant cycle of crime and incarceration.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
339241,341823,"So when I started my job at the Arnold Foundation,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
341823,344559,"I came back to looking at a lot of these questions,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
344559,346213,and I came back to thinking about how,ZJNESMhIxQ0
346213,348596,we had used data and analytics to transform,ZJNESMhIxQ0
348596,351180,the way we did criminal justice in New Jersey.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
351180,353324,And when I look at the criminal justice system,ZJNESMhIxQ0
353324,354980,"in the United States today,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
354980,356619,I feel the exact same way that I did,ZJNESMhIxQ0
356619,359085,"about the state of New Jersey when I started there,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
359085,362313,"which is that we absolutely have to do better,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
362313,364236,and I know that we can do better.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
364236,365941,So I decided to focus,ZJNESMhIxQ0
365941,368158,on using data and analytics,ZJNESMhIxQ0
368158,370519,to help make the most critical decision,ZJNESMhIxQ0
370519,372125,"in public safety,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
372125,374146,and that decision is the determination,ZJNESMhIxQ0
374146,376681,"of whether, when someone has been arrested,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
376681,378596,whether they pose a risk to public safety,ZJNESMhIxQ0
378596,380122,"and should be detained,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
380122,382478,or whether they don't pose a risk to public safety,ZJNESMhIxQ0
382478,384115,and should be released.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
384115,386034,Everything that happens in criminal cases,ZJNESMhIxQ0
386034,387806,comes out of this one decision.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
387806,389302,It impacts everything.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
389302,390652,It impacts sentencing.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
390652,392553,It impacts whether someone gets drug treatment.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
392553,394876,It impacts crime and violence.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
394876,396813,"And when I talk to judges around the United States,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
396813,398741,"which I do all the time now,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
398741,400578,"they all say the same thing,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
400578,403685,"which is that we put dangerous people in jail,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
403685,407210,"and we let non-dangerous, nonviolent people out.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
407210,409443,They mean it and they believe it.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
409443,411176,"But when you start to look at the data,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
411176,413640,"which, by the way, the judges don't have,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
413640,415252,"when we start to look at the data,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
415252,417670,"what we find time and time again,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
417670,419652,is that this isn't the case.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
419652,421333,"We find low-risk offenders,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
421333,425047,"which makes up 50 percent of our
entire criminal justice population,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
425047,427446,we find that they're in jail.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
427446,429932,"Take Leslie Chew, who was a Texas man",ZJNESMhIxQ0
429932,432816,who stole four blankets on a cold winter night.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
432816,435411,"He was arrested, and he was kept in jail",ZJNESMhIxQ0
435411,437464,"on 3,500 dollars bail,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
437464,440240,an amount that he could not afford to pay.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
440240,442828,And he stayed in jail for eight months,ZJNESMhIxQ0
442828,444893,"until his case came up for trial,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
444893,448798,"at a cost to taxpayers of more than 9,000 dollars.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
448798,450795,"And at the other end of the spectrum,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
450795,453077,we're doing an equally terrible job.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
453077,454649,The people who we find,ZJNESMhIxQ0
454649,456668,"are the highest-risk offenders,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
456668,459165,the people who we think have the highest likelihood,ZJNESMhIxQ0
459165,461117,"of committing a new crime if they're released,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
461117,464067,we see nationally that 50 percent of those people,ZJNESMhIxQ0
464067,466041,are being released.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
466041,469215,The reason for this is the way we make decisions.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
469215,470924,Judges have the best intentions,ZJNESMhIxQ0
470924,472876,"when they make these decisions about risk,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
472876,475360,but they're making them subjectively.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
475360,477506,They're like the baseball scouts 20 years ago,ZJNESMhIxQ0
477506,479637,who were using their instinct and their experience,ZJNESMhIxQ0
479637,482316,to try to decide what risk someone poses.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
482316,483846,"They're being subjective,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
483846,486906,"and we know what happens
with subjective decision making,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
486906,489649,which is that we are often wrong.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
489649,491032,What we need in this space,ZJNESMhIxQ0
491032,493584,are strong data and analytics.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
493584,495331,What I decided to look for,ZJNESMhIxQ0
495331,498167,"was a strong data and analytic risk assessment tool,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
498167,500931,something that would let judges actually understand,ZJNESMhIxQ0
500931,503190,with a scientific and objective way,ZJNESMhIxQ0
503190,504837,what the risk was that was posed,ZJNESMhIxQ0
504837,506447,by someone in front of them.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
506447,508096,"I looked all over the country,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
508096,510038,and I found that between five and 10 percent,ZJNESMhIxQ0
510038,511367,of all U.S. jurisdictions,ZJNESMhIxQ0
511367,514345,"actually use any type of risk assessment tool,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
514345,515970,"and when I looked at these tools,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
515970,517830,I quickly realized why.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
517830,520520,"They were unbelievably expensive to administer,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
520520,522048,"they were time-consuming,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
522048,524155,they were limited to the local jurisdiction,ZJNESMhIxQ0
524155,525585,in which they'd been created.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
525585,527378,"So basically, they couldn't be scaled",ZJNESMhIxQ0
527378,529587,or transferred to other places.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
529587,531824,So I went out and built a phenomenal team,ZJNESMhIxQ0
531824,533868,of data scientists and researchers,ZJNESMhIxQ0
533868,535494,and statisticians,ZJNESMhIxQ0
535494,538339,"to build a universal risk assessment tool,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
538339,540732,"so that every single judge in
the United States of America",ZJNESMhIxQ0
540732,545056,"can have an objective, scientific measure of risk.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
545056,546714,"In the tool that we've built,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
546714,549582,what we did was we collected 1.5 million cases,ZJNESMhIxQ0
549582,551280,"from all around the United States,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
551280,552924,"from cities, from counties,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
552924,554435,"from every single state in the country,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
554435,556181,the federal districts.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
556181,558370,"And with those 1.5 million cases,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
558370,560310,which is the largest data set on pretrial,ZJNESMhIxQ0
560310,562115,"in the United States today,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
562115,563980,we were able to basically find that there were,ZJNESMhIxQ0
563980,567302,900-plus risk factors that we could look at,ZJNESMhIxQ0
567302,570168,to try to figure out what mattered most.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
570168,572249,And we found that there were nine specific things,ZJNESMhIxQ0
572249,574484,that mattered all across the country,ZJNESMhIxQ0
574484,577461,and that were the most highly predictive of risk.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
577461,581166,And so we built a universal risk assessment tool.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
581166,582611,And it looks like this.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
582611,585223,"As you'll see, we put some information in,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
585223,587236,"but most of it is incredibly simple,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
587236,588668,"it's easy to use,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
588668,591637,"it focuses on things like the
defendant's prior convictions,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
591637,593616,"whether they've been sentenced to incarceration,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
593616,595880,"whether they've engaged in violence before,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
595880,598273,whether they've even failed to come back to court.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
598273,600773,"And with this tool, we can predict three things.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
600773,602626,"First, whether or not someone will commit",ZJNESMhIxQ0
602626,604191,a new crime if they're released.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
604191,605855,"Second, for the first time,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
605855,607716,"and I think this is incredibly important,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
607716,609639,we can predict whether someone will commit,ZJNESMhIxQ0
609639,611473,an act of violence if they're released.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
611473,613360,And that's the single most important thing,ZJNESMhIxQ0
613360,615167,that judges say when you talk to them.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
615167,616995,"And third, we can predict whether someone",ZJNESMhIxQ0
616995,618985,will come back to court.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
618985,622018,"And every single judge in the
United States of America can use it,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
622018,625830,because it's been created on a universal data set.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
625830,628439,What judges see if they run the risk assessment tool,ZJNESMhIxQ0
628439,630559,is this -- it's a dashboard.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
630559,633407,"At the top, you see the New Criminal Activity Score,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
633407,635336,"six of course being the highest,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
635336,637739,"and then in the middle you
see, Elevated risk of violence.""""",ZJNESMhIxQ0
637739,639485,What that says is that this person,ZJNESMhIxQ0
639485,641545,is someone who has an elevated risk of violence,ZJNESMhIxQ0
641545,643430,that the judge should look twice at.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
643430,644766,"And then, towards the bottom,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
644766,646734,"you see the Failure to Appear Score,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
646734,648126,which again is the likelihood,ZJNESMhIxQ0
648126,651139,that someone will come back to court.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
651139,653352,Now I want to say something really important.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
653352,656079,It's not that I think we should be eliminating,ZJNESMhIxQ0
656079,658323,the judge's instinct and experience,ZJNESMhIxQ0
658323,659927,from this process.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
659927,660985,I don't.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
660985,662992,I actually believe the problem that we see,ZJNESMhIxQ0
662992,665846,"and the reason that we have
these incredible system errors,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
665846,668933,"where we're incarcerating
low-level, nonviolent people",ZJNESMhIxQ0
668933,672105,"and we're releasing high-risk, dangerous people,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
672105,674828,is that we don't have an objective measure of risk.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
674828,676128,But what I believe should happen,ZJNESMhIxQ0
676128,678928,"is that we should take that
data-driven risk assessment",ZJNESMhIxQ0
678928,681969,"and combine that with the
judge's instinct and experience",ZJNESMhIxQ0
681969,684927,to lead us to better decision making.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
684927,688230,"The tool went statewide in Kentucky on July 1,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
688230,691581,"and we're about to go up in a
number of other U.S. jurisdictions.",ZJNESMhIxQ0
691581,694172,"Our goal, quite simply, is that every single judge",ZJNESMhIxQ0
694172,696364,in the United States will use a data-driven risk tool,ZJNESMhIxQ0
696364,698455,within the next five years.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
698455,699807,We're now working on risk tools,ZJNESMhIxQ0
699807,703091,"for prosecutors and for police officers as well,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
703091,705791,to try to take a system that runs today,ZJNESMhIxQ0
705791,708587,"in America the same way it did 50 years ago,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
708587,710684,"based on instinct and experience,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
710684,712539,and make it into one that runs,ZJNESMhIxQ0

715008,716929,"Now, the great news about all this,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
716929,718546,"and we have a ton of work left to do,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
718546,720403,"and we have a lot of culture to change,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
720403,722149,but the great news about all of it,ZJNESMhIxQ0
722149,724017,is that we know it works.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
724017,726170,"It's why Google is Google,",ZJNESMhIxQ0
726170,728632,and it's why all these baseball teams use moneyball,ZJNESMhIxQ0
728632,730413,to win games.,ZJNESMhIxQ0
730413,732150,The great news for us as well,ZJNESMhIxQ0
732150,734046,is that it's the way that we can transform,ZJNESMhIxQ0

deep in the ocean,",wxCtIdI3xL0

436336,439894,"You only need to go back
3.5 billion years ago",wxCtIdI3xL0

447103,448673,"Well, actually, it is.",wxCtIdI3xL0
448673,450574,Look around you -- that's planet Earth.,wxCtIdI3xL0

in very extreme environments",wxCtIdI3xL0

471439,474272,What is left? How are we going to find it?,wxCtIdI3xL0
474272,477276,"So for one moment now
I'm going to take you with me",wxCtIdI3xL0
477276,480130,on a trip into that time machine.,wxCtIdI3xL0

we are at 4,500 meters in the Andes,",wxCtIdI3xL0

pretty much exactly like that --",wxCtIdI3xL0

evaporating lakes everywhere,",wxCtIdI3xL0

512496,516555,"But if we want to understand what's
going on, we need to go a little further.",wxCtIdI3xL0
516555,518470,And the other thing about those sites,wxCtIdI3xL0
518470,521946,"is that exactly like on Mars
three and a half billion years ago,",wxCtIdI3xL0
521946,526463,"the climate is changing very fast,
and water and ice are disappearing.",wxCtIdI3xL0
526463,529678,"But we need to go back to that time
when everything changed on Mars,",wxCtIdI3xL0

532441,533858,Why is that?,wxCtIdI3xL0
533858,535215,"Because when you go higher,",wxCtIdI3xL0
535215,538337,"the atmosphere is getting thinner,
it's getting more unstable,",wxCtIdI3xL0

and you have a lot more U.V. radiation.",wxCtIdI3xL0
543648,544457,"Basically,",wxCtIdI3xL0
544457,549191,"you are getting to those conditions
on Mars when everything changed.",wxCtIdI3xL0

a leisurely trip on the time machine.",wxCtIdI3xL0
556837,559371,"You are not going to be sitting
in that time machine.",wxCtIdI3xL0
559371,562399,"You have to haul 1,000 pounds

in the Andes here.",wxCtIdI3xL0
566184,568784,"That's about 6,000 meters.",wxCtIdI3xL0
568784,572407,"And you also have to sleep
on 42-degree slopes",wxCtIdI3xL0
572407,575518,"and really hope that there won't
be any earthquake that night.",wxCtIdI3xL0
575518,580464,"But when we get to the summit,
we actually find the lake we came for.",wxCtIdI3xL0
580464,585126,"At this altitude, this lake is
experiencing exactly the same conditions",wxCtIdI3xL0
585126,588245,"as those on Mars
three and a half billion years ago.",wxCtIdI3xL0
588245,591170,And now we have to change our voyage,wxCtIdI3xL0
591170,593890,"into an inner voyage inside that lake,",wxCtIdI3xL0
593890,597541,"and to do that, we have to remove
our mountain gear",wxCtIdI3xL0
597541,601847,and actually don suits and go for it.,wxCtIdI3xL0
602277,606452,"But at the time we enter that lake,
at the very moment we enter that lake,",wxCtIdI3xL0
606452,608380,we are stepping back,wxCtIdI3xL0
608380,611561,"three and a half billion years
in the past of another planet,",wxCtIdI3xL0
611561,615661,"and then we are going to get
the answer came for.",wxCtIdI3xL0

630853,633523,"Life is abundant in those lakes,",wxCtIdI3xL0
633523,637630,"but like in many places on Earth
right now and due to climate change,",wxCtIdI3xL0
637630,640324,there is a huge loss in biodiversity.,wxCtIdI3xL0
640744,643740,"In the samples that we took back home,",wxCtIdI3xL0
643740,649556,"36 percent of the bacteria in those lakes
were composed of three species,",wxCtIdI3xL0

that have survived so far.",wxCtIdI3xL0
653375,656162,"Here's another lake,
right next to the first one.",wxCtIdI3xL0
656162,659830,"The red color you see here
is not due to minerals.",wxCtIdI3xL0
659830,663151,"It's actually due to the presence
of a tiny algae.",wxCtIdI3xL0

is really nasty.",wxCtIdI3xL0
667660,671129,"Anywhere on Earth, 11

the U.V. Index reaches 43.",wxCtIdI3xL0

to you over there,",wxCtIdI3xL0
679976,683342,"and the water is so
transparent in those lakes",wxCtIdI3xL0
683342,686675,"that the algae has
nowhere to hide, really,",wxCtIdI3xL0
686675,688965,"and so they are developing
their own sunscreen,",wxCtIdI3xL0
688965,690749,and this is the red color you see.,wxCtIdI3xL0
690749,693310,"But they can adapt only so far,",wxCtIdI3xL0
693310,695788,"and then when all the water
is gone from the surface,",wxCtIdI3xL0
695788,698388,microbes have only one solution left:,wxCtIdI3xL0
698388,700246,They go underground.,wxCtIdI3xL0
700246,703171,"And those microbes, the rocks
you see in that slide here,",wxCtIdI3xL0
703171,706391,"well, they are actually
living inside rocks",wxCtIdI3xL0
706391,709585,"and they are using the protection
of the translucence of the rocks",wxCtIdI3xL0
709585,711382,to get the good part of the U.V.,wxCtIdI3xL0
711382,715126,"and discard the part that could
actually damage their DNA.",wxCtIdI3xL0
715126,717401,And this is why we are taking our rover,wxCtIdI3xL0
717401,720977,"to train them to search
for life on Mars in these areas,",wxCtIdI3xL0
720977,724714,"because if there was life on Mars
three and a half billion years ago,",wxCtIdI3xL0
724714,729074,"it had to use the same strategy
to actually protect itself.",wxCtIdI3xL0
729864,732242,"Now, it is pretty obvious",wxCtIdI3xL0
732242,735770,"that going to extreme environments
is helping us very much",wxCtIdI3xL0
735770,739761,"for the exploration of Mars
and to prepare missions.",wxCtIdI3xL0
739761,744100,"So far, it has helped us to understand
the geology of Mars.",wxCtIdI3xL0
744100,748221,"It has helped to understand the past
climate of Mars and its evolution,",wxCtIdI3xL0
748221,751208,but also its habitability potential.,wxCtIdI3xL0
751208,756747,"Our most recent rover on Mars
has discovered traces of organics.",wxCtIdI3xL0
756747,759706,"Yeah, there are organics
at the surface of Mars.",wxCtIdI3xL0
759706,763607,And it also discovered traces of methane.,wxCtIdI3xL0
763607,766152,"And we don't know yet
if the methane in question",wxCtIdI3xL0
766152,769990,is really from geology or biology.,wxCtIdI3xL0
769990,774859,"Regardless, what we know is
that because of the discovery,",wxCtIdI3xL0
774859,778100,"the hypothesis that there is still
life present on Mars today",wxCtIdI3xL0
778100,780455,remains a viable one.,wxCtIdI3xL0
780455,785652,"So by now, I think I have convinced you
that Mars is very special to us,",wxCtIdI3xL0
785652,788628,"but it would be a mistake to think
that Mars is the only place",wxCtIdI3xL0
788628,793574,"in the solar system that is interesting
to find potential microbial life.",wxCtIdI3xL0
794434,798352,"And the reason is because
Mars and the Earth",wxCtIdI3xL0
798352,801143,"could have a common root
to their tree of life,",wxCtIdI3xL0
801143,805290,"but when you go beyond Mars,
it's not that easy.",wxCtIdI3xL0
805290,807900,"Celestial mechanics
is not making it so easy",wxCtIdI3xL0
807900,810315,"for an exchange
of material between planets,",wxCtIdI3xL0
810315,814355,"and so if we were to discover
life on those planets,",wxCtIdI3xL0
814355,816212,it would be different from us.,wxCtIdI3xL0
816212,818050,It would be a different type of life.,wxCtIdI3xL0
818050,820903,"But in the end, it might be just us,",wxCtIdI3xL0
820903,822899,"it might be us and Mars,",wxCtIdI3xL0
822899,826382,"or it can be many trees of life
in the solar system.",wxCtIdI3xL0
826382,830110,"I don't know the answer yet,
but I can tell you something:",wxCtIdI3xL0
830110,834542,"No matter what the result is,
no matter what that magic number is,",wxCtIdI3xL0
834542,836553,it is going to give us a standard,wxCtIdI3xL0
836553,841081,"by which we are going to be able
to measure the life potential,",wxCtIdI3xL0
841081,844191,"abundance and diversity
beyond our own solar system.",wxCtIdI3xL0

by our generation.",wxCtIdI3xL0

but only if we dare to explore.",wxCtIdI3xL0
851654,853740,"Now, finally,",wxCtIdI3xL0
853740,857708,"if somebody tells you that looking
for alien microbes is not cool",wxCtIdI3xL0

a philosophical conversation with them,",wxCtIdI3xL0

you can tell them they're wrong.",wxCtIdI3xL0
867804,870572,"Well, organic material
is going to tell you",wxCtIdI3xL0

147789.0,149876.0,was always predicated on action.,QeAGu40vZzI
149876.0,152661.0,He believed that government could be built,QeAGu40vZzI
152661.0,154301.0,"by the people,",QeAGu40vZzI
154301.0,158850.0,and we call those people civic hackers.,QeAGu40vZzI
158850.0,161305.0,So it's no wonder that the values,QeAGu40vZzI
161305.0,163973.0,"that underly a healthy democracy,",QeAGu40vZzI
163973.0,166966.0,like collaboration and empowerment,QeAGu40vZzI
166966.0,169029.0,"and participation and enterprise,",QeAGu40vZzI
169029.0,172515.0,are the same values that underly the Internet.,QeAGu40vZzI
172515.0,174611.0,And so it's no surprise that many hackers,QeAGu40vZzI
174611.0,177968.0,"are turning their attention to
the problem of government.",QeAGu40vZzI
177968.0,180021.0,But before I give you a few examples,QeAGu40vZzI
180021.0,181843.0,"of what civic hacking looks like,",QeAGu40vZzI
181843.0,183359.0,I want to make clear that you don't have,QeAGu40vZzI
183359.0,185453.0,to be a programmer to be a civic hacker.,QeAGu40vZzI
185453.0,187208.0,You just have to believe that you can bring,QeAGu40vZzI
187208.0,189475.0,a 21st-century tool set to bear,QeAGu40vZzI
189475.0,191914.0,on the problems that government faces.,QeAGu40vZzI
191914.0,193959.0,And we hear all the time from our community,QeAGu40vZzI
193959.0,196247.0,of civic hackers at Code for America,QeAGu40vZzI
196247.0,198855.0,"that they didn't understand
how much nontechnical work",QeAGu40vZzI
198855.0,200881.0,actually went into civic hacking projects.,QeAGu40vZzI
200881.0,202372.0,So keep that in mind.,QeAGu40vZzI
202372.0,206462.0,All of you are potential civic hackers.,QeAGu40vZzI
206462.0,208482.0,So what does civic hacking look like?,QeAGu40vZzI
208482.0,210746.0,"Our team last year in Honolulu,",QeAGu40vZzI
210746.0,213361.0,which in this case was three full-time fellows,QeAGu40vZzI
213361.0,215513.0,"who were doing a year of public service,",QeAGu40vZzI
215513.0,219478.0,were asked by the city to rebuild the website.,QeAGu40vZzI
219478.0,222557.0,"And it's a massive thing of
tens of thousands of pages",QeAGu40vZzI
222557.0,224673.0,which just wasn't going to be possible,QeAGu40vZzI
224673.0,226426.0,in the few months that they had.,QeAGu40vZzI
226426.0,228883.0,"So instead, they decided to build a parallel site",QeAGu40vZzI
228883.0,231345.0,that better conformed to how citizens actually,QeAGu40vZzI
231345.0,234684.0,want to interact with information on a city website.,QeAGu40vZzI
234684.0,236621.0,"They're looking for answers to questions,",QeAGu40vZzI
236621.0,239247.0,"and they want to take action when they're done,",QeAGu40vZzI
239247.0,241533.0,which is really hard to do from a site,QeAGu40vZzI
241533.0,243182.0,that looks like this.,QeAGu40vZzI
243182.0,245427.0,"So our team built Honolulu Answers,",QeAGu40vZzI
245427.0,247793.0,which is a super-simple search interface,QeAGu40vZzI
247793.0,250246.0,where you enter a search term or a question,QeAGu40vZzI
250246.0,252944.0,and get back plain language answers,QeAGu40vZzI
252944.0,255384.0,that drive a user towards action.,QeAGu40vZzI
255384.0,258241.0,"Now the site itself was easy enough to build,",QeAGu40vZzI
258241.0,260144.0,but the team was faced with the challenge,QeAGu40vZzI
260144.0,262854.0,of how they populate all of the content.,QeAGu40vZzI
262854.0,264530.0,It would have taken the three of them,QeAGu40vZzI
264530.0,265907.0,"a very long time,",QeAGu40vZzI
265907.0,268906.0,"especially given that none of
them are actually from Honolulu.",QeAGu40vZzI
268906.0,270981.0,"And so they did something that's really radical,",QeAGu40vZzI
270981.0,272654.0,when you think about how government,QeAGu40vZzI
272654.0,274695.0,is used to working.,QeAGu40vZzI
274695.0,277707.0,They asked citizens to write the content.,QeAGu40vZzI
277707.0,279201.0,So you've heard of a hack-a-thon.,QeAGu40vZzI
279201.0,280865.0,"They held a write-a-thon,",QeAGu40vZzI
280865.0,283502.0,where on one Saturday afternoon --,QeAGu40vZzI
283502.0,285543.0,(What do I do about wild pigs,QeAGu40vZzI
,,,QeAGu40vZzI
285543.0,289589.0,"Wild pigs are a huge problem
in Honolulu, apparently.",QeAGu40vZzI
289589.0,291632.0,"In one Saturday afternoon,",QeAGu40vZzI
291632.0,293966.0,they were able to populate most of the content,QeAGu40vZzI
293966.0,295627.0,"for most of the frequently asked questions,",QeAGu40vZzI
295627.0,297860.0,"but more importantly than that,",QeAGu40vZzI
297860.0,301975.0,"they created a new way for citizens
to participate in their government.",QeAGu40vZzI
301975.0,305020.0,"Now, I think this is a really cool story in and of itself,",QeAGu40vZzI
305020.0,307357.0,but it gets more awesome.,QeAGu40vZzI
307357.0,309963.0,On the National Day of Civic Hacking,QeAGu40vZzI
309963.0,312374.0,"this past June in Oakland, where I live,",QeAGu40vZzI
312374.0,314403.0,the Code For America team in Oakland,QeAGu40vZzI
314403.0,316603.0,took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers,QeAGu40vZzI
316603.0,318614.0,"and turned it into Oakland Answers,",QeAGu40vZzI
318614.0,320693.0,and again we held a write-a-thon,QeAGu40vZzI
320693.0,324041.0,where we took the most frequently asked questions,QeAGu40vZzI
324041.0,325703.0,"and had citizens write the answers to them,",QeAGu40vZzI
325703.0,327172.0,and I got into the act.,QeAGu40vZzI
327172.0,330773.0,"I authored this answer, and a few others.",QeAGu40vZzI
330773.0,333885.0,And I'm trying to this day to articulate,QeAGu40vZzI
333885.0,336931.0,the sense of empowerment and responsibility,QeAGu40vZzI
336931.0,340511.0,that I feel for the place that I live,QeAGu40vZzI
340511.0,344553.0,based simply on this small act of participation.,QeAGu40vZzI
344553.0,348278.0,And by stitching together my small act,QeAGu40vZzI
348278.0,351084.0,"with the thousands of other
small acts of participation",QeAGu40vZzI
351084.0,353665.0,"that we're enabling through civic hacking,",QeAGu40vZzI
353665.0,356449.0,we think we can reenergize citizenship,QeAGu40vZzI
356449.0,359499.0,and restore trust in government.,QeAGu40vZzI
359499.0,360836.0,"At this point, you may be wondering",QeAGu40vZzI
360836.0,362562.0,what city officials think of all this.,QeAGu40vZzI
362562.0,364115.0,They actually love it.,QeAGu40vZzI
364115.0,366309.0,"As most of you guys know, cities are being asked",QeAGu40vZzI
366309.0,369030.0,"every day to do more with less,",QeAGu40vZzI
369030.0,371228.0,and they're always looking for innovative solutions,QeAGu40vZzI
371228.0,372962.0,to entrenched problems.,QeAGu40vZzI
372962.0,376496.0,So when you give citizens a way to participate,QeAGu40vZzI
376496.0,378334.0,"beyond attending a town hall meeting,",QeAGu40vZzI
378334.0,380286.0,cities can actually capture,QeAGu40vZzI
380286.0,383040.0,the capacity in their communities,QeAGu40vZzI
383040.0,386075.0,to do the business of government.,QeAGu40vZzI
386075.0,388068.0,Now I don't want to leave the impression,QeAGu40vZzI
388068.0,390180.0,that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon.,QeAGu40vZzI
390180.0,391883.0,"It's happening across the globe,",QeAGu40vZzI
391883.0,393536.0,and one of my favorite examples,QeAGu40vZzI
393536.0,395967.0,"is from Mexico City, where earlier this year,",QeAGu40vZzI
395967.0,398077.0,the Mexico House of Representatives,QeAGu40vZzI
398077.0,402389.0,"entered into a contract with
a software development firm",QeAGu40vZzI
402389.0,405569.0,to build an app that legislators would use,QeAGu40vZzI
405569.0,406820.0,to track bills.,QeAGu40vZzI
406820.0,409496.0,So this was just for the handful of legislators,QeAGu40vZzI
409496.0,412070.0,in the House.,QeAGu40vZzI
412070.0,414739.0,And the contract was a two-year contract,QeAGu40vZzI
414739.0,418665.0,for 9.3 million dollars.,QeAGu40vZzI
418665.0,421017.0,"Now a lot of people were really angry about this,",QeAGu40vZzI
421017.0,423964.0,especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars,QeAGu40vZzI
423964.0,426268.0,was an absolutely outrageous amount of money,QeAGu40vZzI
426268.0,428239.0,for what was a very simple app.,QeAGu40vZzI
428239.0,430668.0,"But instead of taking to the streets,",QeAGu40vZzI
430668.0,432876.0,they issued a challenge.,QeAGu40vZzI
432876.0,435707.0,They asked programmers in Mexico,QeAGu40vZzI
435707.0,438910.0,"to build something better and cheaper,",QeAGu40vZzI
438910.0,443361.0,"and they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars --",QeAGu40vZzI
443361.0,445262.0,"10,000 times cheaper",QeAGu40vZzI
445262.0,446910.0,"than the government contract,",QeAGu40vZzI
446910.0,450013.0,and they gave the entrants 10 days.,QeAGu40vZzI
450013.0,451825.0,"And in those 10 days,",QeAGu40vZzI
451825.0,455886.0,"they submitted 173 apps,",QeAGu40vZzI
455886.0,458520.0,five of which were presented to Congress,QeAGu40vZzI
458520.0,460621.0,and are still in the app store today.,QeAGu40vZzI
460621.0,462442.0,"And because of this action,",QeAGu40vZzI
462442.0,464570.0,"that contract was vacated,",QeAGu40vZzI
464570.0,466702.0,and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City,QeAGu40vZzI

468459.0,470917.0,Code for Mexico City.,QeAGu40vZzI
470917.0,473668.0,"And so what you see in all three of these places,",QeAGu40vZzI
473668.0,476485.0,"in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City,",QeAGu40vZzI
476485.0,479676.0,"are the elements that are
at the core of civic hacking.",QeAGu40vZzI
479676.0,482699.0,"It's citizens who saw things
that could be working better",QeAGu40vZzI
482699.0,484630.0,"and they decided to fix them,",QeAGu40vZzI

486289.0,489480.0,a 21st-century ecosystem of participation.,QeAGu40vZzI
489480.0,491510.0,They're creating a whole new set of ways,QeAGu40vZzI
491510.0,493516.0,"for citizens to be involved,",QeAGu40vZzI
493516.0,497461.0,besides voting or signing a petition or protesting.,QeAGu40vZzI
497461.0,501438.0,They can actually build government.,QeAGu40vZzI
501438.0,504574.0,"So back to our friend Ben Franklin,",QeAGu40vZzI
504574.0,507320.0,"who, one of his lesser-known accomplishments",QeAGu40vZzI
507320.0,511195.0,was that in 1736 he founded,QeAGu40vZzI
511195.0,514753.0,"the first volunteer firefighting
company in Philadelphia,",QeAGu40vZzI
514753.0,516452.0,called a brigade.,QeAGu40vZzI
516452.0,518678.0,And it's because he and his friends noticed,QeAGu40vZzI
518678.0,520377.0,that the city was having trouble keeping up,QeAGu40vZzI
520377.0,522447.0,"with all the fires that were happening in the city,",QeAGu40vZzI
522447.0,525236.0,"so in true civic hacker fashion,",QeAGu40vZzI
525236.0,527886.0,they built a solution.,QeAGu40vZzI
527886.0,530396.0,And we have our own brigades at Code for America,QeAGu40vZzI

20260,23260,about the power of the human mind.,bSidnKdH5_4
23260,25260,And what I'd like to do today,bSidnKdH5_4
25260,27260,is give you a vivid example,bSidnKdH5_4
27260,29260,of how that power can be unleashed,bSidnKdH5_4
29260,32260,"when someone is in a survival situation,",bSidnKdH5_4
32260,35260,how the will to survive can bring that out in people.,bSidnKdH5_4
36260,39260,This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest;,bSidnKdH5_4
39260,43260,it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.,bSidnKdH5_4
43260,46260,"And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.",bSidnKdH5_4
46260,48260,So I'll take you through that,bSidnKdH5_4
48260,51260,and we'll see what it's like,bSidnKdH5_4
51260,53260,when someone really,bSidnKdH5_4
53260,55260,summons the will to survive.,bSidnKdH5_4
55260,57260,"OK, this is Mount Everest.",bSidnKdH5_4
57260,59260,"It's 29,035 feet high.",bSidnKdH5_4
59260,62260,"I've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic,",bSidnKdH5_4
62260,64260,making tectonic plate measurements;,bSidnKdH5_4
64260,66260,"twice, I went with NASA",bSidnKdH5_4
66260,69260,doing remote sensing devices.,bSidnKdH5_4
69260,71260,It was on my fourth trip to Everest,bSidnKdH5_4
71260,74260,that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.,bSidnKdH5_4
74260,76260,And the Sherpas told us then,bSidnKdH5_4
76260,78260,"that was a very bad omen,",bSidnKdH5_4
78260,80260,and we should have listened to them.,bSidnKdH5_4
80260,83260,Everest is an extreme environment.,bSidnKdH5_4
83260,86260,There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.,bSidnKdH5_4
86260,88260,"Near the summit, temperatures",bSidnKdH5_4
88260,90260,can be 40 degrees below zero.,bSidnKdH5_4
90260,92260,You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.,bSidnKdH5_4
92260,94260,It's actually a wind-chill factor,bSidnKdH5_4
94260,97260,which is lower than a summer day on Mars.,bSidnKdH5_4
98260,100260,"I remember one time being up near the summit,",bSidnKdH5_4
100260,102260,I reached into my down jacket,bSidnKdH5_4
102260,104260,"for a drink from my water bottle,",bSidnKdH5_4
104260,106260,"inside my down jacket,",bSidnKdH5_4
106260,109260,only to discover that the water was already frozen solid.,bSidnKdH5_4
109260,111260,That gives you an idea of just how severe,bSidnKdH5_4
111260,114260,things are near the summit.,bSidnKdH5_4
115260,117260,"OK, this is the route up Everest.",bSidnKdH5_4
117260,121260,"It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.",bSidnKdH5_4
121260,124260,"Camp One, 2,000 feet higher.",bSidnKdH5_4
124260,126260,"Camp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up,",bSidnKdH5_4
126260,128260,what's called the Western Cwm.,bSidnKdH5_4
128260,130260,"CampThree is at the base of Lhotse,",bSidnKdH5_4
130260,133260,"which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.",bSidnKdH5_4
133260,136260,And then Camp Four is the highest camp;,bSidnKdH5_4
136260,139260,"that's 3,000 feet short of the summit.",bSidnKdH5_4
140260,142260,This is a view of base camp.,bSidnKdH5_4
142260,145260,"This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.",bSidnKdH5_4
145260,147260,It's the highest point you can bring your yaks,bSidnKdH5_4
147260,149260,before you have to unload.,bSidnKdH5_4
149260,151260,And this is what they unloaded for me:,bSidnKdH5_4
151260,153260,"I had four yak loads of medical supplies,",bSidnKdH5_4
153260,155260,"which are dumped in a tent,",bSidnKdH5_4
155260,158260,and here I am trying to arrange things.,bSidnKdH5_4
158260,160260,This was our expedition.,bSidnKdH5_4
160260,162260,"It was a National Geographic expedition,",bSidnKdH5_4
162260,164260,but it was organized by The Explorers Club.,bSidnKdH5_4
164260,166260,"There were three other expeditions on the mountain,",bSidnKdH5_4
166260,168260,"an American team, a New Zealand team",bSidnKdH5_4
168260,170260,and an IMAX team.,bSidnKdH5_4
172260,175260,"And, after actually two months of preparation,",bSidnKdH5_4
175260,178260,we built our camps all the way up the mountain.,bSidnKdH5_4
178260,180260,"This is a view looking up the icefall,",bSidnKdH5_4
180260,182260,"the first 2,000 feet of the climb",bSidnKdH5_4
182260,184260,up from base camp.,bSidnKdH5_4
185260,187260,And here's a picture in the icefall;,bSidnKdH5_4
187260,190260,"it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly,",bSidnKdH5_4
190260,192260,and it actually changes every day.,bSidnKdH5_4
192260,194260,"When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze;",bSidnKdH5_4
194260,196260,you can't even see over the top.,bSidnKdH5_4
197260,199260,This is near the top of the icefall.,bSidnKdH5_4
199260,202260,You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.,bSidnKdH5_4
202260,204260,"That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.",bSidnKdH5_4
204260,207260,These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.,bSidnKdH5_4
210260,212260,This is me crossing a crevasse.,bSidnKdH5_4
212260,215260,We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.,bSidnKdH5_4
217260,219260,That's another crevasse.,bSidnKdH5_4
219260,221260,"Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more,",bSidnKdH5_4
221260,223260,and one of my climbing friends says that,bSidnKdH5_4
223260,225260,the reason we actually climb at night,bSidnKdH5_4
225260,227260,is because if we ever saw the bottom,bSidnKdH5_4
227260,229260,"of what we're climbing over,",bSidnKdH5_4
229260,232260,we would never do it.,bSidnKdH5_4
232260,234260,Okay. This is Camp One.,bSidnKdH5_4
234260,236260,It's the first flat spot you can reach,bSidnKdH5_4
236260,239260,after you get up to the top of the icefall.,bSidnKdH5_4
239260,242260,"And from there we climb up to Camp Two,",bSidnKdH5_4
242260,244260,which is sort of the foreground.,bSidnKdH5_4
244260,246260,"These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face,",bSidnKdH5_4
246260,248260,that mountain toward Camp Three.,bSidnKdH5_4
248260,250260,They're on fixed ropes here.,bSidnKdH5_4
250260,252260,"A fall here, if you weren't roped in,",bSidnKdH5_4
252260,255260,"would be 5,000 feet down.",bSidnKdH5_4
256260,258260,This is a view taken from camp three.,bSidnKdH5_4
258260,260260,"You can see the Lhotse face is in profile,",bSidnKdH5_4
260260,263260,"it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it,",bSidnKdH5_4
263260,265260,so you put the camp halfway through.,bSidnKdH5_4
265260,267260,"If you notice, the summit of Everest is black.",bSidnKdH5_4
267260,269260,There's no ice over it.,bSidnKdH5_4
269260,271260,"And that's because Everest is so high,",bSidnKdH5_4
271260,273260,"it's in the jet stream,",bSidnKdH5_4
273260,275260,"and winds are constantly scouring the face,",bSidnKdH5_4
275260,277260,so no snow gets to accumulate.,bSidnKdH5_4
277260,279260,What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge,bSidnKdH5_4
279260,282260,is actually snow being blown off the summit.,bSidnKdH5_4
285260,287260,"This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four,",bSidnKdH5_4
287260,290260,"moving in, up through the clouds.",bSidnKdH5_4
292260,294260,And this is at Camp Four.,bSidnKdH5_4
294260,297260,"Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours",bSidnKdH5_4
297260,299260,to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.,bSidnKdH5_4
299260,302260,"Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited,",bSidnKdH5_4
302260,304260,"and you either have to go up or go down,",bSidnKdH5_4
304260,307260,make that decision very quickly.,bSidnKdH5_4
307260,309260,This is a picture of Rob Hall.,bSidnKdH5_4
309260,311260,He was the leader of the New Zealand team.,bSidnKdH5_4
311260,313260,This is a radio he used later to call his wife,bSidnKdH5_4
313260,316260,that I'll tell you about.,bSidnKdH5_4
317260,319260,These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.,bSidnKdH5_4
319260,322260,"They're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.",bSidnKdH5_4
322260,324260,"This is not good weather to climb in,",bSidnKdH5_4
324260,327260,"so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.",bSidnKdH5_4
329260,331260,"And, in fact, the wind does die down at night.",bSidnKdH5_4
331260,333260,"It becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.",bSidnKdH5_4
333260,336260,This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.,bSidnKdH5_4
336260,338260,So here are some climbers starting out for the summit,bSidnKdH5_4
338260,340260,on what's called the Triangular Face.,bSidnKdH5_4
340260,342260,It's the first part of climb.,bSidnKdH5_4
342260,344260,"It's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next,",bSidnKdH5_4
344260,347260,and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.,bSidnKdH5_4
348260,350260,So that's what happened.,bSidnKdH5_4
350260,352260,The climbers got on the southeast ridge.,bSidnKdH5_4
352260,354260,This is the view looking at the southeast ridge.,bSidnKdH5_4
354260,356260,The summit would be in the foreground.,bSidnKdH5_4
356260,359260,"From here, it's about 1,500 feet",bSidnKdH5_4
359260,362260,up at a 30-degree angle to the summit.,bSidnKdH5_4
364260,366260,But what happened that year was,bSidnKdH5_4
366260,368260,the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.,bSidnKdH5_4
368260,371260,A storm blew in that no one was anticipating.,bSidnKdH5_4
371260,373260,You can see here some ferocious winds,bSidnKdH5_4
373260,376260,blowing snow way high off the summit.,bSidnKdH5_4
376260,379260,And there were climbers on that summit ridge.,bSidnKdH5_4
380260,382260,This is a picture of me in that area,bSidnKdH5_4
382260,384260,"taken a year before,",bSidnKdH5_4
384260,387260,and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on,bSidnKdH5_4
387260,389260,with a rebreather.,bSidnKdH5_4
389260,391260,I have an oxygen hose connected here.,bSidnKdH5_4
391260,394260,"You can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack --",bSidnKdH5_4
394260,396260,"little titanium tanks, very lightweight --",bSidnKdH5_4
396260,398260,and we're not carrying much else.,bSidnKdH5_4
398260,401260,This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge.,bSidnKdH5_4
401260,404260,"OK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself.",bSidnKdH5_4
404260,406260,"This is on the way toward the summit,",bSidnKdH5_4
406260,409260,"on that 1,500-foot bridge.",bSidnKdH5_4
409260,411260,"All the climbers here are climbing unroped,",bSidnKdH5_4
411260,413260,and the reason is because,bSidnKdH5_4
413260,415260,the drop off is so sheer on either side,bSidnKdH5_4
415260,417260,"that if you were roped to somebody,",bSidnKdH5_4
417260,419260,you'd wind up just pulling them off with you.,bSidnKdH5_4
419260,421260,So each person climbs individually.,bSidnKdH5_4
421260,424260,"And it's not a straight path at all,",bSidnKdH5_4
424260,427260,"it's very difficult climbing,",bSidnKdH5_4
427260,429260,and there's always the risk,bSidnKdH5_4
429260,431260,of falling on either side.,bSidnKdH5_4
431260,433260,"If you fall to your left, you're going to fall",bSidnKdH5_4
433260,435260,"8,000 feet into Nepal;",bSidnKdH5_4
435260,437260,"if you fall to your right,",bSidnKdH5_4
437260,440260,"you're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.",bSidnKdH5_4
440260,442260,So it's probably better to fall into Tibet,bSidnKdH5_4
442260,444260,because you'll live longer.,bSidnKdH5_4
444260,449260,(Laughter),bSidnKdH5_4
449260,452260,"But, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.",bSidnKdH5_4
453260,455260,"OK. Those climbers were up near the summit,",bSidnKdH5_4
455260,459260,"along that summit ridge that you see up there,",bSidnKdH5_4
459260,461260,and I was down here in Camp Three.,bSidnKdH5_4
461260,464260,"My expedition was down in Camp Three,",bSidnKdH5_4
464260,466260,while these guys were up there in the storm.,bSidnKdH5_4
466260,469260,"The storm was so fierce that we had to lay,",bSidnKdH5_4
469260,471260,"fully dressed, fully equipped,",bSidnKdH5_4
471260,473260,laid out on the tent floor,bSidnKdH5_4
473260,475260,to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.,bSidnKdH5_4
475260,477260,It was the worst winds I've ever seen.,bSidnKdH5_4
477260,480260,And the climbers up on the ridge,bSidnKdH5_4
480260,482260,"were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher,",bSidnKdH5_4
482260,485260,and completely exposed to the elements.,bSidnKdH5_4
486260,488260,We were in radio contact with some of them.,bSidnKdH5_4
488260,491260,This is a view taken along the summit ridge.,bSidnKdH5_4
491260,493260,"Rob Hall, we heard by radio,",bSidnKdH5_4
493260,496260,"was up here, at this point in the storm",bSidnKdH5_4
496260,498260,with Doug Hansen.,bSidnKdH5_4
498260,500260,"And we heard that Rob was OK,",bSidnKdH5_4
500260,502260,but Doug was too weak to come down.,bSidnKdH5_4
502260,505260,"He was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.",bSidnKdH5_4
506260,508260,We also got some bad news in the storm,bSidnKdH5_4

598260,601260,The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.,bSidnKdH5_4

612260,614260,"which is really not much, because Camp Three",bSidnKdH5_4
614260,616260,is a little notch cut in the ice,bSidnKdH5_4
616260,618260,in the middle of a 45-degree angle.,bSidnKdH5_4

631260,633260,"So, as the climbers came by me,",bSidnKdH5_4
633260,635260,I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition,bSidnKdH5_4

637260,640260,"The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated,",bSidnKdH5_4
640260,643260,I would give an injection of steroids,bSidnKdH5_4

645260,647260,of lucidity and coordination,bSidnKdH5_4
647260,650260,where they could then work their way further down the mountain.,bSidnKdH5_4

652260,654260,I even gave the injections right through their clothes.,bSidnKdH5_4

663260,666260,There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.,bSidnKdH5_4

673260,676260,"But Rob was now too weak to come down himself,",bSidnKdH5_4
676260,679260,"and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude,",bSidnKdH5_4
679260,681260,he was just beyond rescue,bSidnKdH5_4
681260,683260,and he knew it.,bSidnKdH5_4

685260,687260,to be paged into his wife.,bSidnKdH5_4

703260,705260,"Rob then signed off,",bSidnKdH5_4
705260,708260,and that was the last we ever heard of him.,bSidnKdH5_4

748260,751260,"put oxygen on them and try to revive them,",bSidnKdH5_4

794260,796260,"And then he said,",bSidnKdH5_4

798260,800260,(Laughter),bSidnKdH5_4

809260,811260,"his face, his nose, is burned.",bSidnKdH5_4
811260,814260,"First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis,",bSidnKdH5_4

869260,872260,"generated enough energy,",bSidnKdH5_4
872260,874260,"enough motivation in him,",bSidnKdH5_4
874260,876260,so that he actually got up.,bSidnKdH5_4
876260,878260,"After laying in the snow that long a time,",bSidnKdH5_4
878260,882260,he got up and found his way back to the camp.,bSidnKdH5_4
882260,884260,"And Beck told me that story very quietly,",bSidnKdH5_4

895260,898260,an irreversible hypothermia.,bSidnKdH5_4

901260,903260,on how he did it.,bSidnKdH5_4

921260,923260,where you form images and keep memories;,bSidnKdH5_4
923260,925260,"and the posterior part of your brain,",bSidnKdH5_4
925260,927260,"which contains the cerebellum, which controls motion;",bSidnKdH5_4
927260,929260,"and the brain stem,",bSidnKdH5_4
929260,931260,"where you have your basic maintenance functions,",bSidnKdH5_4
931260,933260,like heartbeat and respiration.,bSidnKdH5_4
933260,936260,"So let's take a cut through the brain here,",bSidnKdH5_4
936260,938260,and imagine that Beck,bSidnKdH5_4
938260,940260,was hooked up to a SPECT scan.,bSidnKdH5_4
940260,942260,This measures dynamic blood flow,bSidnKdH5_4
942260,944260,and therefore energy flow within the brain.,bSidnKdH5_4
944260,946260,"So you have the prefrontal cortex here,",bSidnKdH5_4
946260,948260,lighting up in red.,bSidnKdH5_4
948260,950260,This is a pretty evenly distributed scan.,bSidnKdH5_4
950260,952260,"You have the middle area,",bSidnKdH5_4
952260,954260,"where the temporal lobe might be, in here,",bSidnKdH5_4
954260,957260,"and the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.",bSidnKdH5_4
957260,959260,"This is a roughly normal scan,",bSidnKdH5_4

974260,976260,on getting himself out of trouble.,bSidnKdH5_4
976260,979260,These parts of the brain are quieting down.,bSidnKdH5_4

982260,984260,and he's working pretty hard.,bSidnKdH5_4
984260,987260,He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.,bSidnKdH5_4
990260,993260,"OK, but he's losing ground here.",bSidnKdH5_4

995260,998260,"It's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going,",bSidnKdH5_4

1000260,1002260,his brain is quieting down.,bSidnKdH5_4
1002260,1004260,"He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet,",bSidnKdH5_4
1004260,1006260,there's very little red anywhere.,bSidnKdH5_4
1007260,1009260,Beck is powering down.,bSidnKdH5_4

1013260,1015260,"You go on to the next scan,",bSidnKdH5_4
1015260,1017260,"but, in Beck's case,",bSidnKdH5_4
1017260,1019260,you can see that the middle part of his brain,bSidnKdH5_4
1019260,1022260,is beginning to light up again.,bSidnKdH5_4
1022260,1024260,He's beginning to think about his family.,bSidnKdH5_4
1024260,1026260,He's beginning to have images,bSidnKdH5_4
1026260,1028260,that are motivating him to get up.,bSidnKdH5_4
1028260,1030260,He's developing energy in this area,bSidnKdH5_4
1030260,1032260,through thought.,bSidnKdH5_4
1032260,1035260,And this is how he's going to turn thought,bSidnKdH5_4
1035260,1038260,back into action.,bSidnKdH5_4
1038260,1040260,This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.,bSidnKdH5_4
1040260,1042260,It's an area in which,bSidnKdH5_4
1042260,1045260,a lot of neuroscientists believe,bSidnKdH5_4
1045260,1047260,the seat of will exists.,bSidnKdH5_4
1047260,1050260,"This is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.",bSidnKdH5_4
1050260,1052260,"And, you can see, there's an energy flow",bSidnKdH5_4
1052260,1054260,"going from the mid portion of his brain,",bSidnKdH5_4
1054260,1056260,"where he's got images of his family,",bSidnKdH5_4
1056260,1059260,"into this area, which is powering his will.",bSidnKdH5_4
1061260,1063260,Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger,bSidnKdH5_4
1063260,1065260,to the point where it's actually,bSidnKdH5_4
1065260,1067260,going to be a motivating factor.,bSidnKdH5_4
1067260,1069260,He's going to develop enough energy in that area --,bSidnKdH5_4
1069260,1071260,"after a day, a night and a day --",bSidnKdH5_4
1071260,1074260,to actually motivate himself to get up.,bSidnKdH5_4
1077260,1079260,"And you can see here,",bSidnKdH5_4
1079260,1081260,he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.,bSidnKdH5_4
1081260,1084260,"He's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.",bSidnKdH5_4
1084260,1086260,He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.,bSidnKdH5_4
1086260,1088260,So this energy has been transmitted,bSidnKdH5_4
1088260,1090260,"up toward the front of his brain,",bSidnKdH5_4
1090260,1092260,"and it's getting quieter down here,",bSidnKdH5_4
1092260,1094260,but he's using this energy,bSidnKdH5_4
1094260,1097260,to think about what he has to do to get himself going.,bSidnKdH5_4
1097260,1100260,"And then, that energy is sort of spreading",bSidnKdH5_4
1100260,1102260,throughout his thought areas.,bSidnKdH5_4
1102260,1105260,"He's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.",bSidnKdH5_4

1110260,1113260,His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.,bSidnKdH5_4
1113260,1116260,So this is what I can speculate might have been going on,bSidnKdH5_4
1116260,1119260,had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck,bSidnKdH5_4
1119260,1122260,during this survival epic.,bSidnKdH5_4
1123260,1126260,"So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet,",bSidnKdH5_4

1129260,1131260,compared to what he had done for himself.,bSidnKdH5_4

1143260,1146260,"A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet",bSidnKdH5_4
1146260,1149260,and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.,bSidnKdH5_4

1152260,1155260,"and the other survivors, one by one,",bSidnKdH5_4
1155260,1158260,and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic,bSidnKdH5_4
1158260,1161260,before we even got back to base camp.,bSidnKdH5_4
1161260,1163260,"This is a scene at base camp,",bSidnKdH5_4
1163260,1165260,at one of the camps,bSidnKdH5_4
1165260,1167260,where some of the climbers were lost.,bSidnKdH5_4
1167260,1169260,And we had a memorial service there,bSidnKdH5_4
1169260,1171260,a few days later.,bSidnKdH5_4
1171260,1174260,These are Serphas lighting juniper branches.,bSidnKdH5_4
1174260,1177260,They believe juniper smoke is holy.,bSidnKdH5_4
1177260,1181260,And the climbers stood around on the high rocks,bSidnKdH5_4
1181260,1184260,and spoke of the climbers who were lost,bSidnKdH5_4
1184260,1186260,"up near the summit,",bSidnKdH5_4
1186260,1189260,"turning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.",bSidnKdH5_4

1208260,1211260,"should have died that day, but didn't,",bSidnKdH5_4
1211260,1214260,and that's Beck Weathers.,bSidnKdH5_4

1216260,1219260,"because he was able to generate that incredible willpower,",bSidnKdH5_4

1225260,1227260,These are Tibetan prayer flags.,bSidnKdH5_4

1229260,1231260,"if you write prayers on these flags,",bSidnKdH5_4
1231260,1234260,"the message will be carried up to the gods,",bSidnKdH5_4

13160,16160,"I want to start my story in Germany, in 1877,",7n36qV4Lk94
16160,18160,with a mathematician named Georg Cantor.,7n36qV4Lk94
18160,23160,"And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line,",7n36qV4Lk94
23160,28160,"and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process, a recursive process.",7n36qV4Lk94
28160,30160,"So he starts out with one line, and then two,",7n36qV4Lk94
30160,33160,"and then four, and then 16, and so on.",7n36qV4Lk94
33160,36160,"And if he does this an infinite number of times, which you can do in mathematics,",7n36qV4Lk94
36160,38160,"he ends up with an infinite number of lines,",7n36qV4Lk94
38160,41160,each of which has an infinite number of points in it.,7n36qV4Lk94
41160,45160,So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity.,7n36qV4Lk94
45160,48160,And this blew his mind. Literally. He checked into a sanitarium. (Laughter),7n36qV4Lk94
48160,50160,"And when he came out of the sanitarium,",7n36qV4Lk94
50160,56160,he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory,7n36qV4Lk94
56160,59160,because the largest set of infinity would be God Himself.,7n36qV4Lk94
59160,60160,He was a very religious man.,7n36qV4Lk94
60160,62160,He was a mathematician on a mission.,7n36qV4Lk94
62160,64160,And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing.,7n36qV4Lk94
64160,66160,"A Swedish mathematician, von Koch,",7n36qV4Lk94
66160,70160,"decided that instead of subtracting lines, he would add them.",7n36qV4Lk94
70160,72160,And so he came up with this beautiful curve.,7n36qV4Lk94
72160,75160,And there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape;,7n36qV4Lk94
75160,79160,we can use any seed shape we like.,7n36qV4Lk94
79160,83160,"And I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere -- down there, OK --",7n36qV4Lk94
83160,90160,"and now upon iteration, that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure.",7n36qV4Lk94
90160,92160,So these all have the property of self-similarity:,7n36qV4Lk94
92160,94160,the part looks like the whole.,7n36qV4Lk94
94160,96160,It's the same pattern at many different scales.,7n36qV4Lk94
97160,99160,"Now, mathematicians thought this was very strange",7n36qV4Lk94
99160,104160,"because as you shrink a ruler down, you measure a longer and longer length.",7n36qV4Lk94
104160,106160,"And since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times,",7n36qV4Lk94
106160,112160,"as the ruler shrinks down to infinity, the length goes to infinity.",7n36qV4Lk94
112160,113160,"This made no sense at all,",7n36qV4Lk94
113160,116160,so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books.,7n36qV4Lk94
116160,120160,"They said these are pathological curves, and we don't have to discuss them.",7n36qV4Lk94
120160,121160,(Laughter),7n36qV4Lk94
121160,123160,And that worked for a hundred years.,7n36qV4Lk94
124160,129160,"And then in 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot, a French mathematician,",7n36qV4Lk94
129160,134160,"realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals,",7n36qV4Lk94
134160,136160,you get the shapes of nature.,7n36qV4Lk94
136160,140160,"You get the human lungs, you get acacia trees, you get ferns,",7n36qV4Lk94
140160,142160,you get these beautiful natural forms.,7n36qV4Lk94
142160,146160,If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet --,7n36qV4Lk94
146160,148160,go ahead and do that now --,7n36qV4Lk94
148160,151160,"-- and relax your hand, you'll see a crinkle,",7n36qV4Lk94
151160,154160,"and then a wrinkle within the crinkle, and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right?",7n36qV4Lk94
154160,156160,Your body is covered with fractals.,7n36qV4Lk94
156160,159160,The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes?,7n36qV4Lk94
159160,161160,They were breathing those words with fractal lungs.,7n36qV4Lk94
161160,165160,It's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here.,7n36qV4Lk94
165160,170160,"Again, we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape.",7n36qV4Lk94
170160,175160,"So here's the second iteration, and the third, fourth and so on.",7n36qV4Lk94
175160,177160,So nature has this self-similar structure.,7n36qV4Lk94
177160,179160,Nature uses self-organizing systems.,7n36qV4Lk94
179160,182160,"Now in the 1980s, I happened to notice",7n36qV4Lk94
182160,186160,"that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals.",7n36qV4Lk94
186160,190160,"And I thought, This is fabulous! I wonder why?""""",7n36qV4Lk94
190160,192160,And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why.,7n36qV4Lk94
192160,198160,So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year,7n36qV4Lk94
198160,200160,"asking people why they were building fractals,",7n36qV4Lk94
200160,202160,which is a great job if you can get it.,7n36qV4Lk94
202160,203160,(Laughter),7n36qV4Lk94
203160,210160,"And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city",7n36qV4Lk94
210160,213160,just to see how it would sort of unfold --,7n36qV4Lk94
213160,216160,"but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief,",7n36qV4Lk94
216160,219160,"and my French is not very good; I said something like,",7n36qV4Lk94

226160,229160,"And he said, Oh yeah, yeah! We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle,""",7n36qV4Lk94
229160,231160,"we know all about that.""
71;231160;235160;And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle,""",7n36qV4Lk94
235160,239160,and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here.,7n36qV4Lk94
239160,243160,"And as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite.",7n36qV4Lk94
243160,246160,So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling;,7n36qV4Lk94
246160,251160,it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal.,7n36qV4Lk94
251160,253160,This is a village in southern Zambia.,7n36qV4Lk94
253160,257160,The Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter.,7n36qV4Lk94
257160,259160,You have a huge ring.,7n36qV4Lk94
259160,265160,"The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back,",7n36qV4Lk94
266160,270160,and then you have the chief's ring here towards the back,7n36qV4Lk94
270160,273160,and then the chief's immediate family in that ring.,7n36qV4Lk94
273160,274160,So here's a little fractal model for it.,7n36qV4Lk94
274160,277160,"Here's one house with the sacred altar,",7n36qV4Lk94
277160,280160,"here's the house of houses, the family enclosure,",7n36qV4Lk94
280160,283160,"with the humans here where the sacred altar would be,",7n36qV4Lk94
283160,285160,and then here's the village as a whole --,7n36qV4Lk94
285160,290160,"a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here, the chief's immediate family here,",7n36qV4Lk94
290160,293160,and here there's a tiny village only this big.,7n36qV4Lk94
293160,297160,"Now you might wonder, how can people fit in a tiny village only this big?",7n36qV4Lk94
297160,300160,That's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors.,7n36qV4Lk94
300160,305160,"And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village, right?",7n36qV4Lk94

317160,323160,"So I tried to come up with a seed shape, which, upon iteration, would unfold into this thing.",7n36qV4Lk94

325160,329160,"Let's see, first iteration, second, third, fourth.",7n36qV4Lk94
329160,331160,"Now, after I did the simulation,",7n36qV4Lk94
331160,334160,"I realized the whole village kind of spirals around, just like this,",7n36qV4Lk94
334160,340160,and here's that replicating line -- a self-replicating line that unfolds into the fractal.,7n36qV4Lk94
340160,345160,"Well, I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at.",7n36qV4Lk94
345160,347160,"So, when I got to the village,",7n36qV4Lk94
347160,349160,"I said, Can you take me to the square building?""",7n36qV4Lk94
349160,351160,"I think something's going on there.""
106;351160;354160;And they said, ""Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside""",7n36qV4Lk94
354160,357160,"because that's the sacred altar, where we do sacrifices every year",7n36qV4Lk94

109;360160;362160;And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility""",7n36qV4Lk94
362160,366160,were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this.,7n36qV4Lk94
366160,370160,And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales.,7n36qV4Lk94
370160,372160,So here's a Nankani village in Mali.,7n36qV4Lk94
372160,375160,"And you can see, you go inside the family enclosure --",7n36qV4Lk94
375160,379160,"you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace, stacked recursively.",7n36qV4Lk94

387160,389160,"And when she dies, they have a ceremony",7n36qV4Lk94
389160,394160,where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity.,7n36qV4Lk94
394160,397160,"Once again, infinity is important.",7n36qV4Lk94
398160,402160,"Now, you might ask yourself three questions at this point.",7n36qV4Lk94
402160,406160,Aren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture?,7n36qV4Lk94

408160,410160,"When I first saw those African fractals,",7n36qV4Lk94
410160,414160,"I thought, Wow, so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society,""",7n36qV4Lk94
414160,417160,"that sort of hierarchy, must have a kind of bottom-up architecture.""

532160,535160,and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph;,7n36qV4Lk94
535160,537160,we now call it an Eulerian path --,7n36qV4Lk94
537160,539160,you can never lift your stylus from the surface,7n36qV4Lk94
539160,542160,and you can never go over the same line twice.,7n36qV4Lk94
542160,545160,"But they do it recursively, and they do it with an age-grade system,",7n36qV4Lk94
545160,548160,"so the little kids learn this one, and then the older kids learn this one,",7n36qV4Lk94
548160,551160,"then the next age-grade initiation, you learn this one.",7n36qV4Lk94
551160,554160,"And with each iteration of that algorithm,",7n36qV4Lk94
554160,556160,you learn the iterations of the myth.,7n36qV4Lk94

569160,574160,"Well, you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game.",7n36qV4Lk94
574160,577160,And the folks in Ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns,7n36qV4Lk94
577160,579160,and would use them strategically.,7n36qV4Lk94
579160,581160,So this is very conscious knowledge.,7n36qV4Lk94

597160,601160,"this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako, and I asked him,",7n36qV4Lk94
601160,603160,"How come you're making fractal fences? Because nobody else is.""""",7n36qV4Lk94
603160,605160,And his answer was very interesting.,7n36qV4Lk94

636160,638160,"And I measured out the lengths of straw,",7n36qV4Lk94
638160,640160,"put it on a log-log plot, got the scaling exponent,",7n36qV4Lk94

645160,646160,in the wind engineering handbook.,7n36qV4Lk94
646160,651160,So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology.,7n36qV4Lk94
651160,656160,The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found,7n36qV4Lk94
656160,658160,"was actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code,",7n36qV4Lk94
658160,661160,and this was Bamana sand divination.,7n36qV4Lk94

664160,669160,"You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast,",7n36qV4Lk94
669160,671160,"and often the symbols are very well preserved,",7n36qV4Lk94
671160,677160,so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word --,7n36qV4Lk94
677160,682160,"you draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off,",7n36qV4Lk94
682160,684160,"and if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke,",7n36qV4Lk94
684160,686160,"and if it's an even number, you put down two strokes.",7n36qV4Lk94
686160,689160,"And they did this very rapidly,",7n36qV4Lk94
689160,691160,and I couldn't understand where they were getting --,7n36qV4Lk94
691160,693160,they only did the randomness four times --,7n36qV4Lk94
693160,695160,I couldn't understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols.,7n36qV4Lk94
695160,697160,And they wouldn't tell me.,7n36qV4Lk94

710160,714160,"And I started explaining why I was there in Africa,",7n36qV4Lk94

725160,727160,"And of course, I was only interested in the math,",7n36qV4Lk94
727160,729160,"so the whole time, he kept shaking his head going,",7n36qV4Lk94

737160,741160,"And finally, he revealed the truth of the matter.",7n36qV4Lk94

754160,756160,Odd plus even gives you odd.,7n36qV4Lk94
756160,759160,Even plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even.,7n36qV4Lk94
759160,763160,"It's addition modulo 2, just like in the parity bit check on your computer.",7n36qV4Lk94
763160,767160,"And then you take this symbol, and you put it back in",7n36qV4Lk94
767160,769160,so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols.,7n36qV4Lk94
769160,773160,They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this.,7n36qV4Lk94
773160,775160,"Now, because it's a binary code,",7n36qV4Lk94
775160,777160,you can actually implement this in hardware --,7n36qV4Lk94

are men and women really?",ce31WjiVcY0
39264,41518,"To find out, let's start
by looking at something",ce31WjiVcY0

do really differ on",ce31WjiVcY0

the same distribution as well,",ce31WjiVcY0

quite a big difference.",ce31WjiVcY0
64465,66913,"In fact, the average man
can throw a ball further",ce31WjiVcY0
66913,68620,than about 98 percent of all women.,ce31WjiVcY0

some psychological gender differences",ce31WjiVcY0

at the size of this difference.",ce31WjiVcY0

psychological gender differences",ce31WjiVcY0
101664,103101,ever discovered in psychology.,ce31WjiVcY0

116560,120047,"that 33 percent of men
are better than the average woman,",ce31WjiVcY0

121720,124462,"that would represent
complete gender equality.",ce31WjiVcY0

a case of Mars and Venus.",ce31WjiVcY0

recent study at University College London",ce31WjiVcY0
328635,331189,found that 58 percent of the variation,ce31WjiVcY0
331189,334440,"between different students

the relative contributions",ce31WjiVcY0
342738,344842,"of genes and the environment,",ce31WjiVcY0
344842,347071,what we can do is do a twin study.,ce31WjiVcY0
347071,350647,"So identical twins share
100 percent of their environment",ce31WjiVcY0
350647,352551,"and 100 percent of their genes,",ce31WjiVcY0
352551,355773,"whereas non-identical twins
share 100 percent of their environment,",ce31WjiVcY0
355773,359509,"but just like any brother and sister,
share only 50 percent of their genes.",ce31WjiVcY0

GCSE results are in identical twins",ce31WjiVcY0
363707,366018,"versus non-identical twins,",ce31WjiVcY0
366018,367364,"and doing some clever math,",ce31WjiVcY0
367364,371265,"we can an idea of how much variation
and performance is due to the environment",ce31WjiVcY0
371265,373401,and how much is due to genes.,ce31WjiVcY0
373401,377178,"And it turns out that it's
about 58 percent due to genes.",ce31WjiVcY0
377178,380941,"So this isn't to undermine the hard work
that you and your teachers here put in.",ce31WjiVcY0
380941,384072,"If you didn't quite get the GCSE results
that you were hoping for,",ce31WjiVcY0
384072,388578,"then you can always try blaming
your parents, or at least their genes.",ce31WjiVcY0
388578,390606,One thing that you shouldn't blame,ce31WjiVcY0
390606,393068,"is being a left-brained
or right-brained learner,",ce31WjiVcY0
393068,394879,"because again, this is a myth.",ce31WjiVcY0
394879,397636,"So the myth here is that
the left brain is logical,",ce31WjiVcY0
397636,399435,"it's good with equations like this,",ce31WjiVcY0
399435,403534,"and the right brain is more creative,
so the right brain is better at music.",ce31WjiVcY0
403534,406465,"But again, this is a myth
because nearly everything that you do",ce31WjiVcY0
406465,409275,"involves nearly all parts
of your brain talking together,",ce31WjiVcY0
409275,412595,"even just the most mundane thing
like having a normal conversation.",ce31WjiVcY0
412595,415938,"However, perhaps one reason
why this myth has survived",ce31WjiVcY0
415938,418180,"is that there is
a slight grain of truth to it.",ce31WjiVcY0
418180,419790,So a related version of the myth,ce31WjiVcY0
419790,423073,"is that left-handed people are
more creative than right-handed people,",ce31WjiVcY0
423073,426527,"which kind of makes sense because
your brain controls the opposite hands,",ce31WjiVcY0
426527,427887,"so left-handed people,",ce31WjiVcY0
427887,430313,"the right side of the brain
is slightly more active",ce31WjiVcY0
430313,432118,"than the left-hand side of the brain,",ce31WjiVcY0
432118,434606,"and the idea is the right-hand side
is more creative.",ce31WjiVcY0
434606,436003,"Now, it isn't true per se",ce31WjiVcY0
436003,439204,"that left-handed people are more creative
than right-handed people.",ce31WjiVcY0
439204,441619,"What is true that ambidextrous people,",ce31WjiVcY0
441619,444312,"or people who use both hands
for different tasks,",ce31WjiVcY0
444312,448074,"are more creative thinkers
than one-handed people,",ce31WjiVcY0
448074,449807,because being ambidextrous involves,ce31WjiVcY0
449807,452536,"having both sides of the brain
talk to each other a lot,",ce31WjiVcY0
452536,456298,"which seems to be involved
in creating flexible thinking.",ce31WjiVcY0
456298,458113,The myth of the creative left-hander,ce31WjiVcY0
458113,460171,"arises from the fact
that being ambidextrous",ce31WjiVcY0
460171,463298,"is more common amongst
left-handers than right-handers,",ce31WjiVcY0
463298,466347,"so a grain of truth in the idea
of the creative left-hander,",ce31WjiVcY0
466347,467694,but not much.,ce31WjiVcY0
467694,470131,"A related myth that you've
probably heard of",ce31WjiVcY0
470131,472504,"is that we only use
10 percent of our brains.",ce31WjiVcY0
472504,474030,"This is, again, a complete myth.",ce31WjiVcY0
474030,476749,"Nearly everything that we do,
even the most mundane thing,",ce31WjiVcY0
476749,478932,uses nearly all of our brains.,ce31WjiVcY0
478932,482693,"That said, it is of course true",ce31WjiVcY0
482693,487273,"that most of us don't use our brainpower
quite as well as we could.",ce31WjiVcY0
487273,490239,"So what could we do
to boost our brainpower?",ce31WjiVcY0
490239,492377,"Maybe we could listen
to a nice bit of Mozart.",ce31WjiVcY0
492377,495095,"Have you heard of the idea
of the Mozart effect?",ce31WjiVcY0
495095,498052,"So the idea is that listening
to Mozart makes you smarter",ce31WjiVcY0
498052,500221,"and improves your
performance on I.Q. tests.",ce31WjiVcY0
500221,502326,"Now again, what's interesting
about this myth",ce31WjiVcY0
502326,505767,"is that although it's basically a myth,
there is a grain of truth to it.",ce31WjiVcY0
505767,507541,So the original study found that,ce31WjiVcY0
507541,511322,"participants who were played
Mozart music for a few minutes",ce31WjiVcY0
511322,513621,did better on a subsequent I.Q. test,ce31WjiVcY0
513621,517034,"than participants who simply
sat in silence.",ce31WjiVcY0
517034,520758,"But a follow-up study recruited
some people who liked Mozart music",ce31WjiVcY0
520758,522539,and then another group of people,ce31WjiVcY0
522539,525207,"who were fans of
the horror stories of Stephen King.",ce31WjiVcY0
525207,528771,"And they played the people
the music or the stories.",ce31WjiVcY0
528771,531279,"The people who preferred
Mozart music to the stories",ce31WjiVcY0
531279,534010,"got a bigger I.Q. boost
from the Mozart than the stories,",ce31WjiVcY0
534010,536848,"but the people who preferred
the stories to the Mozart music",ce31WjiVcY0
536848,539955,"got a bigger I.Q. boost
from listening to the Stephen King stories",ce31WjiVcY0
539955,541170,than the Mozart music.,ce31WjiVcY0
541170,543933,"So the truth is that listening
to something that you enjoy",ce31WjiVcY0
543933,547184,"perks you up a bit
and gives you a temporary I.Q. boost",ce31WjiVcY0
547184,549111,on a narrow range of tasks.,ce31WjiVcY0
549111,551479,"There's no suggestion that
listening to Mozart,",ce31WjiVcY0
551479,553104,"or indeed Stephen King stories,",ce31WjiVcY0
553104,556526,"is going to make you any smarter
in the long run.",ce31WjiVcY0
556526,559466,Another version of the Mozart myth,ce31WjiVcY0
559466,564324,"is that listening to Mozart can make you
not only cleverer but healthier, too.",ce31WjiVcY0
564324,566392,"Unfortunately, this doesn't
seem to be true",ce31WjiVcY0
566392,569451,"of someone who listened
to the music of Mozart almost every day,",ce31WjiVcY0
569451,571169,"Mozart himself,",ce31WjiVcY0
571169,574149,"who suffered from gonorrhea,
smallpox, arthritis,",ce31WjiVcY0
574149,578663,"and, what most people think eventually
killed him in the end, syphilis.",ce31WjiVcY0
578673,582035,"This suggests that Mozart
should have bit more careful, perhaps,",ce31WjiVcY0
582035,584613,when choosing his sexual partners.,ce31WjiVcY0
584613,586772,But how do we choose a partner?,ce31WjiVcY0
586772,591798,"So a myth that I have to say
is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists",ce31WjiVcY0
591798,595421,"is that our preferences in a romantic
partner are a product of our culture,",ce31WjiVcY0
595421,597352,that they're very culturally specific.,ce31WjiVcY0
597352,599496,"But in fact, the data don't back this up.",ce31WjiVcY0

607483,609852,"And in every single culture
across the globe,",ce31WjiVcY0

638713,641290,"So moving on from trying
to score with a partner",ce31WjiVcY0

in penalty shootouts,",ce31WjiVcY0
694601,696784,"like, for example, England,",ce31WjiVcY0

they're more likely to miss.",ce31WjiVcY0

763515,766023,"all the participants said
that they firmly believed",ce31WjiVcY0
766023,769807,"that the learning and punishment study
served a worthy scientific purpose",ce31WjiVcY0
769807,772245,"which would have
enduring gains for science",ce31WjiVcY0
772245,778114,"as opposed to the momentary nonfatal
discomfort caused to the participants.",ce31WjiVcY0
779025,781603,"Okay, so I've been talking
for about 12 minutes now,",ce31WjiVcY0
781603,784289,"and you've probably been
sitting there listening to me,",ce31WjiVcY0
784289,786509,"analyzing my speech patterns
and body language",ce31WjiVcY0
786509,790116,"and trying to work out if you should
take any notice of what I'm saying,",ce31WjiVcY0
790116,792577,"whether I'm telling the truth
or whether I'm lying,",ce31WjiVcY0
792577,794759,"but if so you've
probably completely failed,",ce31WjiVcY0
794759,797104,"because although we all think
we can catch a liar",ce31WjiVcY0
797104,799197,"from their body language
and speech patterns,",ce31WjiVcY0
799197,801870,"hundreds of psychological tests
over the years have shown",ce31WjiVcY0
801870,804561,"that all of us, including
police officers and detectives,",ce31WjiVcY0
804561,808061,"are basically at chance when it comes
to detecting lies from body language",ce31WjiVcY0

809642,811686,"Interestingly, there is one exception:",ce31WjiVcY0
811686,813938,TV appeals for missing relatives.,ce31WjiVcY0
813938,816923,"It's quite easy to predict
when the relatives are missing",ce31WjiVcY0
816923,820254,"and when the appealers have in fact
murdered the relatives themselves.",ce31WjiVcY0
820254,823769,"So hoax appealers are more likely
to shake their heads, to look away,",ce31WjiVcY0
823769,825483,"and to make errors in their speech,",ce31WjiVcY0
825483,827498,whereas genuine appealers are more likely,ce31WjiVcY0
827498,829843,"to express hope that the person
will return safely",ce31WjiVcY0
829843,831584,and to avoid brutal language.,ce31WjiVcY0
831584,836187,"So, for example, they might say
taken from us"" rather than ""killed.""""",ce31WjiVcY0
836187,838844,"Speaking of which,
it's about time I killed this talk,",ce31WjiVcY0
838844,842052,"but before I do, I just want
to give you in 30 seconds",ce31WjiVcY0
842052,845423,the overarching myth of psychology.,ce31WjiVcY0
845423,849720,"So the myth is that psychology is just
a collection of interesting theories,",ce31WjiVcY0
849720,853241,"all of which say something useful
and all of which have something to offer.",ce31WjiVcY0
853241,855740,"What I hope to have shown you
in the past few minutes",ce31WjiVcY0
855740,857325,is that this isn't true.,ce31WjiVcY0
857325,860584,"What we need to do is assess
psychological theories",ce31WjiVcY0
860584,862468,"by seeing what predictions they make,",ce31WjiVcY0
862468,865289,"whether that is that listening to Mozart
makes you smarter,",ce31WjiVcY0
865289,870056,"that you learn better when information is
presented in your preferred learning style",ce31WjiVcY0
870056,873521,"or whatever it is, all of these
are testable empirical predictions,",ce31WjiVcY0
873521,875306,and the only way we can make progress,ce31WjiVcY0
875306,877426,"is to test these predictions
against the data",ce31WjiVcY0
877426,879755,"in tightly controlled
experimental studies.",ce31WjiVcY0
879755,882889,"And it's only by doing so
that we can hope to discover",ce31WjiVcY0
882889,885513,"which of these theories
are well supported,",ce31WjiVcY0
885513,888903,"and which, like all the ones
I've told you about today, are myths.",ce31WjiVcY0

13721,16181,I have a confession to make.,MbBHVL4hT90
16181,19420,"I am addicted to adventure,",MbBHVL4hT90
19420,21859,"and as a young boy,",MbBHVL4hT90
21859,24367,I would rather look outside the window,MbBHVL4hT90
24367,27101,at the birds in the trees and the sky,MbBHVL4hT90

43170,47692,"other than being slightly
dyslexic because I'm a lefty.",MbBHVL4hT90

51807,54388,"Curiosity, to me,",MbBHVL4hT90
54388,56361,is about our connection,MbBHVL4hT90
56361,59606,"with the world, with the universe.",MbBHVL4hT90
59606,61496,"It's about seeing what's
around that next coral head",MbBHVL4hT90
61496,63195,"or what's around that next tree,",MbBHVL4hT90
63195,65254,and learning more not only about our environment,MbBHVL4hT90
65254,67324,but about ourselves.,MbBHVL4hT90
67324,69854,"Now, my dream of dreams,",MbBHVL4hT90

80879,82243,"As a matter of fact,",MbBHVL4hT90
82243,85798,if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is,MbBHVL4hT90

119352,122412,at the bottom of the sea.,MbBHVL4hT90
122412,125378,And so there was a great curiosity in my soul,MbBHVL4hT90
125378,128145,when I went to go visit a TED [Prize winner],MbBHVL4hT90
128145,129580,by the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle.,MbBHVL4hT90
129580,131064,Maybe you've heard of her.,MbBHVL4hT90
131064,134840,"Two years ago, she was staked out",MbBHVL4hT90

137684,139667,"to try and save it,",MbBHVL4hT90
139667,141355,to try and petition,MbBHVL4hT90
141355,143145,for us not to scrap it,MbBHVL4hT90
143145,145546,and bring it back on land.,MbBHVL4hT90
145546,147458,We've only had about a dozen or so,MbBHVL4hT90
147458,149888,scientific labs at the bottom of the sea.,MbBHVL4hT90
149888,151800,There's only one left in the world:,MbBHVL4hT90
151800,153021,it's nine miles offshore,MbBHVL4hT90
153021,155355,and 65 feet down.,MbBHVL4hT90
155355,157010,It's called Aquarius.,MbBHVL4hT90
157010,159382,"Aquarius, in some fashion,",MbBHVL4hT90
159382,161631,"is a dinosaur,",MbBHVL4hT90
161631,163971,"an ancient robot chained to the bottom,",MbBHVL4hT90
163971,167391,this Leviathan.,MbBHVL4hT90
167391,169546,"In other ways, it's a legacy.",MbBHVL4hT90
169546,172430,"And so with that visit, I realized
that my time is short",MbBHVL4hT90
172430,174681,if I wanted to experience,MbBHVL4hT90
174681,179708,what it was like to become an aquanaut.,MbBHVL4hT90
179708,182194,When we swam towards this after many,MbBHVL4hT90
182194,184940,"moons of torture and two years of preparation,",MbBHVL4hT90
184940,189909,this habitat waiting to invite us,MbBHVL4hT90
189909,192925,was like a new home.,MbBHVL4hT90
192925,195120,And the point of going down to,MbBHVL4hT90
195120,198967,and living at this habitat was not to stay inside.,MbBHVL4hT90
198967,201566,"It wasn't about living at something
the size of a school bus.",MbBHVL4hT90
201566,204772,It was about giving us the luxury of time,MbBHVL4hT90
204772,207821,"outside to wander, to explore,",MbBHVL4hT90
207821,211704,to understand more about this oceanic final frontier.,MbBHVL4hT90
211704,214011,We had megafauna come and visit us.,MbBHVL4hT90
214011,217551,"This spotted eagle ray is a fairly
common sight in the oceans.",MbBHVL4hT90
217551,220183,"But why this is so important,",MbBHVL4hT90
220183,221758,"why this picture is up,",MbBHVL4hT90
221758,225223,"is because this particular animal
brought his friends around,",MbBHVL4hT90
225223,228370,"and instead of being the
pelagic animals that they were,",MbBHVL4hT90
228370,229760,"they started getting curious about us,",MbBHVL4hT90
229760,233749,"these new strangers that were
moving into the neighborhood,",MbBHVL4hT90
233749,236268,doing things with plankton.,MbBHVL4hT90
236268,238970,"We were studying all sorts of animals and critters,",MbBHVL4hT90
238970,241457,"and they got closer and closer to us,",MbBHVL4hT90
241457,243239,"and because of the luxury of time,",MbBHVL4hT90
243239,245590,"these animals, these residents of the coral reef,",MbBHVL4hT90
245590,247004,"were starting to get used to us,",MbBHVL4hT90
247004,250681,"and these pelagics that
normal travel through stopped.",MbBHVL4hT90
250681,253184,This particular animal actually circled,MbBHVL4hT90
253184,257335,for 31 full days during our mission.,MbBHVL4hT90
257335,259675,So mission 31 wasn't so much,MbBHVL4hT90
259675,261587,about breaking records.,MbBHVL4hT90
261587,266021,It was about that human-ocean connection.,MbBHVL4hT90
266021,268175,"Because of the luxury of time, we were able",MbBHVL4hT90
268175,272134,to study animals such as sharks and grouper,MbBHVL4hT90
272134,274384,in aggregations that we've never seen before.,MbBHVL4hT90
274384,278970,"It's like seeing dogs and
cats behaving well together.",MbBHVL4hT90
278970,280745,Even being able to commune with animals,MbBHVL4hT90
280745,281872,"that are much larger than us,",MbBHVL4hT90
281872,284634,such as this endangered goliath grouper,MbBHVL4hT90

287896,290205,"Of course, just like any neighbor,",MbBHVL4hT90

292725,294345,"the goliath grouper barks at us,",MbBHVL4hT90
294345,296141,and this bark is so powerful,MbBHVL4hT90
296141,298800,that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all,MbBHVL4hT90
298800,300769,within a split second.,MbBHVL4hT90
300769,302286,"For us, it's just telling us to go back",MbBHVL4hT90
302286,306918,into the habitat and leave them alone.,MbBHVL4hT90
306918,310149,"Now, this wasn't just about adventure.",MbBHVL4hT90
310149,311978,There was actually a serious note to it.,MbBHVL4hT90
311978,315279,"We did a lot of science, and again,
because of the luxury of time,",MbBHVL4hT90
315279,317845,we were able to do over three years of science,MbBHVL4hT90
317845,320306,in 31 days.,MbBHVL4hT90
320306,322522,"In this particular case, we were using a PAM,",MbBHVL4hT90
322522,324243,"or, let me just see if I can get this straight,",MbBHVL4hT90
324243,328262,a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer.,MbBHVL4hT90
328262,331465,"And our scientists from FIU, MIT,",MbBHVL4hT90
331465,333520,and from Northeastern,MbBHVL4hT90
333520,336493,were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do,MbBHVL4hT90
336493,338181,when we're not around.,MbBHVL4hT90
338181,340734,"The Pulse Amplitude Modulated
Fluorometer, or PAM,",MbBHVL4hT90
340734,343240,gauges the fluorescence of corals,MbBHVL4hT90

345717,349103,as well as climate change-related issues.,MbBHVL4hT90
349103,352601,"We used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools,",MbBHVL4hT90
352601,354930,"such as this sonde, or what I like to call",MbBHVL4hT90
354930,361084,"the sponge proctologist, whereby the sonde",MbBHVL4hT90
361084,363887,itself tests for metabolism rates,MbBHVL4hT90
363887,366987,"in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge,",MbBHVL4hT90
366987,369338,or the redwoods of the [ocean].,MbBHVL4hT90
369338,370610,And this gives us a much better gauge,MbBHVL4hT90
370610,372928,of what's happening underwater,MbBHVL4hT90
372928,375863,"with regard to climate change-related issues,",MbBHVL4hT90
375863,377651,and how the dynamics of that,MbBHVL4hT90
377651,380261,affect us here on land.,MbBHVL4hT90
380261,382743,"And finally, we looked at predator-prey behavior.",MbBHVL4hT90
382743,384671,"And predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing,",MbBHVL4hT90
384671,387168,because as we take away some of the predators,MbBHVL4hT90
387168,389339,"on these coral reefs around the world,",MbBHVL4hT90
389339,392904,"the prey, or the forage fish, act very differently.",MbBHVL4hT90
392904,394558,What we realized is,MbBHVL4hT90
394558,397741,"not only do they stop taking care of the reef,",MbBHVL4hT90
397741,399665,"darting in, grabbing a little bit of algae",MbBHVL4hT90
399665,401184,"and going back into their homes,",MbBHVL4hT90
401184,403163,they start spreading out and disappearing,MbBHVL4hT90
403163,405278,from those particular coral reefs.,MbBHVL4hT90
405278,407606,"Well, within that 31 days,",MbBHVL4hT90
407606,410295,we were able to generate over 10 scientific papers,MbBHVL4hT90
410295,413426,on each one of these topics.,MbBHVL4hT90
413426,418132,"But the point of adventure is not only to learn,",MbBHVL4hT90
418132,420525,"it's to be able to share that
knowledge with the world,",MbBHVL4hT90
420525,424507,"and with that, thanks to a
couple of engineers at MIT,",MbBHVL4hT90
424507,427840,"we were able to use a prototype
camera called the Edgertronic",MbBHVL4hT90
427840,430901,"to capture slow-motion video,",MbBHVL4hT90
430901,433673,"up to 20,000 frames per second",MbBHVL4hT90

436693,438937,It's available to every one of us.,MbBHVL4hT90
438937,441655,And that particular camera gives us an insight,MbBHVL4hT90
441655,444280,into what fairly common animals do,MbBHVL4hT90
444280,446526,but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye.,MbBHVL4hT90
446526,448836,Let me show you a quick video,MbBHVL4hT90
448836,450906,of what this camera does.,MbBHVL4hT90
450906,453741,You can see the silky bubble come out,MbBHVL4hT90
453741,455920,of our hard hats.,MbBHVL4hT90
455920,458252,It gives us an insight,MbBHVL4hT90
458252,460613,into some of the animals that we were sitting,MbBHVL4hT90
460613,462571,right next to for 31 days,MbBHVL4hT90
462571,465280,"and never normally would have paid attention to,",MbBHVL4hT90
465280,467160,such as hermit crabs.,MbBHVL4hT90
467160,470175,"Now, using a cutting-edge piece of technology",MbBHVL4hT90
470175,472300,that's not really meant for the oceans,MbBHVL4hT90
472300,474444,is not always easy.,MbBHVL4hT90
474444,476992,"We sometimes had to put the camera upside down,",MbBHVL4hT90
476992,479552,"cordon it back to the lab,",MbBHVL4hT90
479552,482073,and actually man the trigger,MbBHVL4hT90
482073,484247,from the lab itself.,MbBHVL4hT90
484247,486441,But what this gives us,MbBHVL4hT90
486441,489275,is the foresight to look at and analyze,MbBHVL4hT90
489275,492482,in scientific and engineering terms,MbBHVL4hT90
492482,495646,some of the most amazing behavior,MbBHVL4hT90
495646,496901,"that the human eye just can't pick up,",MbBHVL4hT90
496901,499950,such as this manta shrimp,MbBHVL4hT90
499950,501718,"trying to catch its prey,",MbBHVL4hT90
501718,507217,within about .3 seconds.,MbBHVL4hT90
507217,510312,"That punch is as strong as a .22 caliber bullet,",MbBHVL4hT90
510312,511657,and if you ever try to catch a bullet,MbBHVL4hT90
511657,515675,"in mid-flight with your eye, impossible.",MbBHVL4hT90
515675,516978,But now we can see things,MbBHVL4hT90

89330,92330,"that can self-replicate in the laboratory,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
92330,94330,and we've been trying to just see if,nKZ-GjSaqgo
94330,97330,we can come up with an even smaller genome.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
98330,100330,We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes,nKZ-GjSaqgo
100330,103330,out of the 500 or so that are here.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
103330,105330,"When we look at its metabolic map,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
105330,107330,it's relatively simple,nKZ-GjSaqgo

109330,111330,"trust me, this is simple --",nKZ-GjSaqgo

113330,116330,"that we can knock out one at a time,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
116330,118330,it's very unlikely that this would yield,nKZ-GjSaqgo
118330,120330,a living cell.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
121330,123330,So we decided the only way forward,nKZ-GjSaqgo
123330,126330,was to actually synthesize this chromosome,nKZ-GjSaqgo
126330,129330,so we could vary the components,nKZ-GjSaqgo
129330,133330,to ask some of these most fundamental questions.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
133330,135330,And so we started down the road of:,nKZ-GjSaqgo
135330,138330,can we synthesize a chromosome?,nKZ-GjSaqgo
139330,141330,Can chemistry permit making,nKZ-GjSaqgo
141330,143330,these really large molecules,nKZ-GjSaqgo
143330,145330,where we've never been before?,nKZ-GjSaqgo
145330,148330,"And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?",nKZ-GjSaqgo
148330,151330,"A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.",nKZ-GjSaqgo
152330,155330,"So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing",nKZ-GjSaqgo
155330,158330,at an exponential pace.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
158330,161330,Our ability to write the genetic code,nKZ-GjSaqgo
161330,163330,has been moving pretty slowly,nKZ-GjSaqgo
163330,166330,"but has been increasing,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
166330,170330,"and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.",nKZ-GjSaqgo
171330,173330,We started this over 15 years ago.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
173330,176330,"It took several stages, in fact,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
176330,179330,starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
180330,182330,But it turns out synthesizing DNA,nKZ-GjSaqgo
182330,184330,is very difficult.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
184330,187330,There are tens of thousands of machines around the world,nKZ-GjSaqgo
187330,189330,that make small pieces of DNA --,nKZ-GjSaqgo
189330,192330,30 to 50 letters in length --,nKZ-GjSaqgo
192330,195330,"and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
195330,197330,the more errors there are.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
197330,199330,So we had to create a new method,nKZ-GjSaqgo
199330,202330,for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
203330,206330,"And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information",nKZ-GjSaqgo
206330,208330,of the genome of phi X174.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
208330,211330,It's a small virus that kills bacteria.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
212330,215330,"We designed the pieces, went through our error correction",nKZ-GjSaqgo
215330,217330,and had a DNA molecule,nKZ-GjSaqgo
217330,220330,"of about 5,000 letters.",nKZ-GjSaqgo
220330,224330,The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical,nKZ-GjSaqgo
224330,226330,"and put it in the bacteria,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
226330,230330,"and the bacteria started to read this genetic code,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
230330,232330,made the viral particles.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
232330,234330,The viral particles then were released from the cells,nKZ-GjSaqgo
234330,237330,and came back and killed the E. coli.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
237330,240330,I was talking to the oil industry recently,nKZ-GjSaqgo
240330,243330,and I said they clearly understood that model.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
243330,246330,(Laughter),nKZ-GjSaqgo
246330,249330,They laughed more than you guys are. (Laughter),nKZ-GjSaqgo
250330,252330,"And so, we think this is a situation",nKZ-GjSaqgo
252330,255330,where the software can actually build its own hardware,nKZ-GjSaqgo
255330,257330,in a biological system.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
257330,259330,But we wanted to go much larger:,nKZ-GjSaqgo
259330,262330,we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome --,nKZ-GjSaqgo
262330,266330,"it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code --",nKZ-GjSaqgo
266330,269330,so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses,nKZ-GjSaqgo
269330,271330,so we could actually vary the cassettes,nKZ-GjSaqgo
271330,273330,to understand,nKZ-GjSaqgo
273330,276330,what the actual components of a living cell are.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
276330,278330,"Design is critical,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
278330,281330,"and if you're starting with digital information in the computer,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
281330,285330,that digital information has to be really accurate.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
285330,288330,"When we first sequenced this genome in 1995,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
288330,292330,"the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.",nKZ-GjSaqgo
292330,294330,"We actually found, on resequencing it,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
294330,297330,"30 errors; had we used that original sequence,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
297330,300330,it never would have been able to be booted up.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
300330,302330,Part of the design is designing pieces,nKZ-GjSaqgo
302330,305330,that are 50 letters long,nKZ-GjSaqgo
305330,308330,that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces,nKZ-GjSaqgo
308330,310330,to build smaller subunits,nKZ-GjSaqgo
310330,313330,we have to design so they can go together.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
313330,316330,We design unique elements into this.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
316330,318330,You may have read that we put watermarks in.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
318330,320330,Think of this:,nKZ-GjSaqgo
320330,323330,"we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T.",nKZ-GjSaqgo
323330,326330,Triplets of those letters,nKZ-GjSaqgo
326330,328330,"code for roughly 20 amino acids,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
328330,331330,such that there's a single letter designation,nKZ-GjSaqgo
331330,333330,for each of the amino acids.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
333330,336330,"So we can use the genetic code to write out words,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
336330,338330,"sentences, thoughts.",nKZ-GjSaqgo
339330,341330,"Initially, all we did was autograph it.",nKZ-GjSaqgo
341330,344330,Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
344330,346330,We designed these pieces so,nKZ-GjSaqgo
346330,349330,we can just chew back with enzymes;,nKZ-GjSaqgo
350330,353330,there are enzymes that repair them and put them together.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
353330,355330,"And we started making pieces,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
355330,359330,"starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
359330,363330,"put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
363330,367330,"then put sets of those going up to 72,000.",nKZ-GjSaqgo
367330,369330,"At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance",nKZ-GjSaqgo
369330,371330,so we could sequence them,nKZ-GjSaqgo
371330,374330,because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust,nKZ-GjSaqgo
374330,377330,that you can see in a minute.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
377330,380330,We're trying to get to the point of automation.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
380330,382330,"So, this looks like a basketball playoff.",nKZ-GjSaqgo
382330,384330,When we get into these really large pieces,nKZ-GjSaqgo
384330,388330,"over 100,000 base pairs,",nKZ-GjSaqgo
388330,390330,they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli --,nKZ-GjSaqgo
390330,394330,it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology --,nKZ-GjSaqgo
394330,398330,and so we turned to other mechanisms.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
398330,401330,We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination,nKZ-GjSaqgo
401330,404330,that biology uses to repair DNA,nKZ-GjSaqgo
404330,407330,that can put pieces together.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
407330,408330,Here's an example of it:,nKZ-GjSaqgo
408330,409330,there's an organism called,nKZ-GjSaqgo
409330,411330,Deinococcus radiodurans,nKZ-GjSaqgo
411330,414330,that can take three millions rads of radiation.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
414330,418330,"You can see in the top panel, its chromosome just gets blown apart.",nKZ-GjSaqgo
418330,421330,"Twelve to 24 hours later, it put it",nKZ-GjSaqgo
421330,423330,back together exactly as it was before.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
423330,426330,We have thousands of organisms that can do this.,nKZ-GjSaqgo
426330,428330,These organisms can be totally desiccated;,nKZ-GjSaqgo

235837,238827,"CA: Now, you had said that",zLNXIXingyU
238827,241056,Ed Snowden had other avenues,zLNXIXingyU

243751,247077,The comeback on that is a couple of things:,zLNXIXingyU

checks and balances on each other,",zLNXIXingyU

375733,377743,"like, terrorists is the iconic example,",zLNXIXingyU

380837,382699,"drug traffickers,",zLNXIXingyU
382699,386663,"people who are trying to build
advanced weaponry, nuclear weapons,",zLNXIXingyU
386663,388626,"and build delivery systems for those,",zLNXIXingyU
388626,392257,"and nation-states who might be executing aggression against their immediate neighbors,",zLNXIXingyU

401567,406568,in very discrete and measured and controlled ways.,zLNXIXingyU
406568,409356,"So the unconstrained disclosure
of those capabilities",zLNXIXingyU
409356,411640,means that as adversaries see them,zLNXIXingyU
411640,414003,"and recognize, Hey, I might be vulnerable to this,""""",zLNXIXingyU

428801,430889,to have insight into what they're doing.,zLNXIXingyU
430889,433853,The net effect of that is that our people,zLNXIXingyU
433853,435746,"who are overseas in dangerous places,",zLNXIXingyU
435746,437610,"whether they're diplomats or military,",zLNXIXingyU

443060,446011,the threats that are coming their way.,zLNXIXingyU
446011,448070,CA: So that's a general response saying that,zLNXIXingyU
448070,450167,"because of his revelations,",zLNXIXingyU
450167,453033,access that you had to certain types of information,zLNXIXingyU
453033,456604,"has been shut down, has been closed down.",zLNXIXingyU
456604,460153,But the concern is that the nature of that access,zLNXIXingyU
460153,463857,was not necessarily legitimate in the first place.,zLNXIXingyU
463857,466639,"I mean, describe to us this Bullrun program",zLNXIXingyU
466639,468768,where it's alleged that the NSA,zLNXIXingyU
468768,471153,specifically weakened security,zLNXIXingyU
471153,475722,"in order to get the type of
access that you've spoken of.",zLNXIXingyU
475722,480863,"RL: So there are, when our",zLNXIXingyU
480863,483575,"legitimate foreign intelligence targets
of the type that I described before,",zLNXIXingyU
483575,486611,use the global telecommunications system,zLNXIXingyU
486611,488694,"as their communications methodology,",zLNXIXingyU
488694,490108,"and they do, because it's a great system,",zLNXIXingyU
490108,492946,"it's the most complex system ever devised by man,",zLNXIXingyU
492946,494593,"and it is a wonder,",zLNXIXingyU
494593,496197,and lots of folks in the room there,zLNXIXingyU
496197,498548,are responsible for the creation,zLNXIXingyU
498548,499917,"and enhancement of that,",zLNXIXingyU
499917,502790,and it's just a wonderful thing.,zLNXIXingyU
502790,505287,But it's also used by people who are,zLNXIXingyU
505287,507318,working against us and our allies.,zLNXIXingyU
507318,509749,"And so if I'm going to pursue them,",zLNXIXingyU
509749,511484,I need to have the capability,zLNXIXingyU
511484,513659,"to go after them,",zLNXIXingyU
513659,516485,"and again, the controls are in",zLNXIXingyU
516485,519006,"how I apply that capability,",zLNXIXingyU
519006,521252,not that I have the capability itself.,zLNXIXingyU
521252,523024,"Otherwise, if we could make it so that",zLNXIXingyU
523024,525210,"all the bad guys used one corner of the Internet,",zLNXIXingyU
525210,527166,"we could have a domain, badguy.com.",zLNXIXingyU
527166,528660,"That would be awesome,",zLNXIXingyU
528660,530802,and we could just concentrate all our efforts there.,zLNXIXingyU
530802,532134,That's not how it works.,zLNXIXingyU
532134,534345,They're trying to hide,zLNXIXingyU
534345,536150,from the government's ability,zLNXIXingyU
536150,539433,"to isolate and interdict their actions,",zLNXIXingyU
539433,542245,and so we have to swim in that same space.,zLNXIXingyU
542245,543847,But I will tell you this.,zLNXIXingyU
543847,545326,So NSA has two missions.,zLNXIXingyU
545326,546776,One is the Signals Intelligence mission,zLNXIXingyU
546776,550403,"that we've unfortunately read so
much about in the press.",zLNXIXingyU
550403,552141,"The other one is the Information Assurance mission,",zLNXIXingyU
552141,555052,"which is to protect the national security
systems of the United States,",zLNXIXingyU
555052,557020,"and by that, that's things like",zLNXIXingyU
557020,559036,"the communications that the president uses,",zLNXIXingyU
559036,561641,"the communications that
control our nuclear weapons,",zLNXIXingyU
561641,563910,"the communications that our
military uses around the world,",zLNXIXingyU
563910,566401,"and the communications that we use with our allies,",zLNXIXingyU
566401,568125,and that some of our allies themselves use.,zLNXIXingyU
568125,573962,"And so we make recommendations
on standards to use,",zLNXIXingyU
573962,575789,"and we use those same standards,",zLNXIXingyU
575789,577667,and so we are invested,zLNXIXingyU
577667,579912,in making sure that those communications,zLNXIXingyU
579912,583525,are secure for their intended purposes.,zLNXIXingyU
583525,585474,CA: But it sounds like what you're saying is that,zLNXIXingyU
585474,589219,"when it comes to the Internet at large,",zLNXIXingyU
589219,591846,any strategy is fair game,zLNXIXingyU
591846,594762,if it improves America's safety.,zLNXIXingyU
594762,596820,And I think this is partly where there is such,zLNXIXingyU
596820,598205,"a divide of opinion,",zLNXIXingyU
598205,599455,that there's a lot of people in this room,zLNXIXingyU
599455,600828,and around the world,zLNXIXingyU
600828,602478,who think very differently about the Internet.,zLNXIXingyU
602478,605465,They think of it as a momentous,zLNXIXingyU
605465,607063,"invention of humanity,",zLNXIXingyU
607063,610227,"kind of on a par with the
Gutenberg press, for example.",zLNXIXingyU
610227,612682,It's the bringer of knowledge to all.,zLNXIXingyU
612682,614386,It's the connector of all.,zLNXIXingyU
614386,617771,And it's viewed in those sort of idealistic terms.,zLNXIXingyU
617771,619344,"And from that lens,",zLNXIXingyU
619344,621941,what the NSA has done is equivalent to,zLNXIXingyU
621941,624101,the authorities back in Germany,zLNXIXingyU
624101,626970,inserting some device into every printing press,zLNXIXingyU
626970,630511,that would reveal which books people bought,zLNXIXingyU
630511,632531,and what they read.,zLNXIXingyU
632531,634762,"Can you understand that from that viewpoint,",zLNXIXingyU
634762,638967,it feels outrageous?,zLNXIXingyU
638967,642269,"RL: I do understand that, and I actually share
the view of the utility of the Internet,",zLNXIXingyU
642269,643971,and I would argue it's bigger than the Internet.,zLNXIXingyU
643971,646382,It is a global telecommunications system.,zLNXIXingyU
646382,648833,"The Internet is a big chunk of
that, but there is a lot more.",zLNXIXingyU
648833,652176,And I think that people have legitimate concerns,zLNXIXingyU
652176,658482,"about the balance between
transparency and secrecy.",zLNXIXingyU
658482,660422,That's sort of been couched as a balance,zLNXIXingyU
660422,664058,between privacy and national security.,zLNXIXingyU
664058,665478,I don't think that's the right framing.,zLNXIXingyU
665478,667843,I think it really is transparency and secrecy.,zLNXIXingyU
667843,671402,"And so that's the national and international conversation that we're having,",zLNXIXingyU
671402,672801,"and we want to participate in that, and want",zLNXIXingyU
672801,675241,people to participate in it in an informed way.,zLNXIXingyU
675241,677152,"So there are things,",zLNXIXingyU
677152,678602,"let me talk there a little bit more,",zLNXIXingyU
678602,682371,"there are things that we need
to be transparent about:",zLNXIXingyU
682371,684398,"our authorities, our processes,",zLNXIXingyU
684398,686452,"our oversight, who we are.",zLNXIXingyU
686452,688218,"We, NSA, have not done a good job of that,",zLNXIXingyU
688218,689606,and I think that's part of the reason,zLNXIXingyU
689606,692335,that this has been so revelational,zLNXIXingyU
692335,694531,and so sensational in the media.,zLNXIXingyU
694531,698657,"Nobody knew who we were. We were the No Such Agency, the Never Say Anything.",zLNXIXingyU
698657,701306,There's takeoffs of our logo,zLNXIXingyU
701306,704325,of an eagle with headphones on around it.,zLNXIXingyU
704325,707948,And so that's the public characterization.,zLNXIXingyU
707948,712284,"And so we need to be more
transparent about those things.",zLNXIXingyU
712284,713702,"What we don't need to be transparent about,",zLNXIXingyU

countries that we work with",zLNXIXingyU
718623,720716,and that we help provide information,zLNXIXingyU

722438,723947,"and their people,",zLNXIXingyU
723947,727837,it's bad to expose operations and capabilities,zLNXIXingyU

that we're all working against,",zLNXIXingyU
733129,738092,"the generally recognized bad guys,",zLNXIXingyU
738092,740392,to counter those.,zLNXIXingyU
740392,743417,CA: But isn't it also bad to deal,zLNXIXingyU
743417,746821,a kind of body blow to the American companies,zLNXIXingyU
746821,748717,that have essentially given the world,zLNXIXingyU
748717,753897,most of the Internet services that matter?,zLNXIXingyU
753897,757289,RL: It is. It's really the companies are,zLNXIXingyU
757289,760677,"in a tough position, as are we,",zLNXIXingyU
760677,762618,"because the companies,",zLNXIXingyU
762618,764950,"we compel them to provide information,",zLNXIXingyU
764950,766933,just like every other nation in the world does.,zLNXIXingyU
766933,770207,Every industrialized nation in the world,zLNXIXingyU
770207,772307,has a lawful intercept program,zLNXIXingyU
772307,774805,where they are requiring companies,zLNXIXingyU

790880,792898,any country that you choose to name.,zLNXIXingyU

995023,997318,It's not necessarily the actual words,zLNXIXingyU

1008016,1010483,to a former NSA analyst who said,zLNXIXingyU

1015406,1018633,you present yourself as you want to be presented.,zLNXIXingyU
1018633,1021339,"With metadata, who knows what the conclusions are",zLNXIXingyU
1021339,1022755,that are drawn?,zLNXIXingyU
1022755,1024761,Is there anything to that?,zLNXIXingyU
1024761,1026550,RL: I don't really understand that argument.,zLNXIXingyU
1026550,1029450,"I think that metadata's important
for a couple of reasons.",zLNXIXingyU
1029450,1033928,Metadata is the information that lets you,zLNXIXingyU
1033928,1037319,find connections that people are trying to hide.,zLNXIXingyU
1037319,1039330,So when a terrorist is corresponding,zLNXIXingyU
1039330,1041175,with somebody else who's not known to us,zLNXIXingyU
1041175,1043783,"but is engaged in doing or
supporting terrorist activity,",zLNXIXingyU
1043783,1046209,or someone who's violating international sanctions,zLNXIXingyU
1046209,1049286,by providing nuclear weapons-related material,zLNXIXingyU
1049286,1051612,"to a country like Iran or North Korea,",zLNXIXingyU
1051612,1055189,"is trying to hide that activity
because it's illicit activity.",zLNXIXingyU
1055189,1057999,What metadata lets you do is connect that.,zLNXIXingyU
1057999,1059531,The alternative to that,zLNXIXingyU
1059531,1061150,is one that's much less efficient,zLNXIXingyU
1061150,1062531,"and much more invasive of privacy,",zLNXIXingyU
1062531,1066367,which is gigantic amounts of content collection.,zLNXIXingyU
1066367,1067760,"So metadata, in that sense,",zLNXIXingyU

1091175,1093487,"that face America overall,",zLNXIXingyU
1093487,1096699,where would you place terrorism?,zLNXIXingyU
1096699,1099797,RL: I think terrorism is still number one.,zLNXIXingyU
1099797,1103701,I think that we have never been in a time,zLNXIXingyU
1103701,1105692,where there are more places,zLNXIXingyU
1105692,1108545,where things are going badly,zLNXIXingyU
1108545,1112446,and forming the petri dish in which terrorists,zLNXIXingyU
1112446,1117756,take advantage of the lack of governance.,zLNXIXingyU
1117756,1121393,"An old boss of mine, Tom Fargo, Admiral Fargo,",zLNXIXingyU
1121393,1123606,used to describe it as arcs of instability.,zLNXIXingyU
1123606,1125974,And so you have a lot of those arcs of instability,zLNXIXingyU
1125974,1127667,"in the world right now,",zLNXIXingyU
1127667,1129504,"in places like Syria, where there's a civil war",zLNXIXingyU
1129504,1132214,"going on and you have massive numbers,",zLNXIXingyU
1132214,1133949,thousands and thousands of foreign fighters,zLNXIXingyU
1133949,1135682,who are coming into Syria,zLNXIXingyU
1135682,1137185,to learn how to be terrorists,zLNXIXingyU
1137185,1139286,"and practice that activity,",zLNXIXingyU
1139286,1141985,and lots of those people are Westerners,zLNXIXingyU
1141985,1145714,who hold passports to European countries,zLNXIXingyU
1145714,1147466,"or in some cases the United States,",zLNXIXingyU
1147466,1149867,and so they are basically learning how,zLNXIXingyU
1149867,1153347,to do jihad and have expressed intent,zLNXIXingyU
1153347,1155760,to go out and do that later on,zLNXIXingyU
1155760,1157427,in their home countries.,zLNXIXingyU
1157427,1158748,"You've got places like Iraq,",zLNXIXingyU
1158748,1161530,"which is suffering from a high
level of sectarian violence,",zLNXIXingyU
1161530,1164181,again a breeding ground for terrorism.,zLNXIXingyU
1164181,1166687,And you have the activity in the Horn of Africa,zLNXIXingyU
1166687,1169734,and the Sahel area of Africa.,zLNXIXingyU
1169734,1172262,"Again, lots of weak governance",zLNXIXingyU
1172262,1176153,which forms a breeding ground for terrorist activity.,zLNXIXingyU
1176153,1178147,So I think it's very serious. I think it's number one.,zLNXIXingyU
1178147,1180401,I think number two is cyber threat.,zLNXIXingyU
1180401,1186165,I think cyber is a threat in three ways:,zLNXIXingyU
1186165,1189919,"One way, and probably the most common way",zLNXIXingyU
1189919,1192111,"that people have heard about it,",zLNXIXingyU
1192111,1194111,"is due to the theft of intellectual property,",zLNXIXingyU
1194111,1198415,"so basically, foreign countries going in,",zLNXIXingyU
1198415,1200292,"stealing companies' secrets,",zLNXIXingyU
1200292,1202290,and then providing that information,zLNXIXingyU
1202290,1204027,to state-owned enterprises,zLNXIXingyU
1204027,1206976,or companies connected to the government,zLNXIXingyU
1206976,1209479,to help them leapfrog technology,zLNXIXingyU
1209479,1211554,or to gain business intelligence,zLNXIXingyU

activities that's going on right now.",zLNXIXingyU
1217961,1219428,Several nation-states are doing it.,zLNXIXingyU

1222653,1224032,You're probably aware that there have been,zLNXIXingyU
1224032,1226003,a spate of those directed against,zLNXIXingyU

1229591,1232208,"Again, that's a nation-state who
is executing those attacks,",zLNXIXingyU

1275374,1276638,"I mean, first of all,",zLNXIXingyU
1276638,1278196,a lot of people who look at risk,zLNXIXingyU
1278196,1279413,and look at the numbers,zLNXIXingyU
1279413,1281673,don't understand this belief that terrorism,zLNXIXingyU

1283557,1285185,"Apart from September 11,",zLNXIXingyU
1285185,1287540,"I think the numbers are that

1348291,1352768,"over the NSA programs, by the way.",zLNXIXingyU
1352768,1355460,So that's not an accident that those things happen.,zLNXIXingyU
1355460,1357785,That's hard work. That's us finding intelligence,zLNXIXingyU

1371359,1376625,your idea of nuclear or chem-bio-threat,zLNXIXingyU
1376625,1378141,is not at all far-fetched,zLNXIXingyU

1425392,1428370,"the U.S. telephony metadata program,",zLNXIXingyU
1428370,1430410,and the other one is,zLNXIXingyU
1430410,1432004,"popularly called the PRISM program,",zLNXIXingyU
1432004,1435252,"and it's actually section 702
of the FISA Amendment Act.",zLNXIXingyU

140260,142260,that a wrist sprain is a trivial event,J6--CMhcCfQ
142260,144260,in a person's life.,J6--CMhcCfQ
144260,146260,"Wrap it in an ACE bandage,",J6--CMhcCfQ
146260,148260,"take some ibuprofen for a week or two,",J6--CMhcCfQ
148260,150260,and that's the end of the story.,J6--CMhcCfQ
150260,153260,"But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.",J6--CMhcCfQ
154260,156260,This is what her arm looked like,J6--CMhcCfQ
156260,159260,when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.,J6--CMhcCfQ
159260,161260,"You can see that the arm is discolored,",J6--CMhcCfQ
161260,163260,purplish in color.,J6--CMhcCfQ
163260,165260,It was cadaverically cold to the touch.,J6--CMhcCfQ
165260,167260,"The muscles were frozen, paralyzed --",J6--CMhcCfQ
167260,170260,dystonic is how we refer to that.,J6--CMhcCfQ
170260,173260,"The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands,",J6--CMhcCfQ
173260,176260,"to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow,",J6--CMhcCfQ
176260,178260,almost all the way to her shoulder.,J6--CMhcCfQ
178260,180260,"But the worst part was,",J6--CMhcCfQ
180260,183260,not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.,J6--CMhcCfQ
183260,186260,"The worst part was that she had allodynia,",J6--CMhcCfQ
186260,189260,the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated,J6--CMhcCfQ
189260,191260,with the feather and with the torch.,J6--CMhcCfQ
191260,193260,The lightest touch of her arm --,J6--CMhcCfQ
193260,195260,"the touch of a hand,",J6--CMhcCfQ
195260,198260,"the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on --",J6--CMhcCfQ
198260,202260,"caused excruciating, burning pain.",J6--CMhcCfQ
202260,205260,How can the nervous system get this so wrong?,J6--CMhcCfQ
205260,207260,How can the nervous system,J6--CMhcCfQ
207260,209260,misinterpret an innocent sensation,J6--CMhcCfQ
209260,211260,like the touch of a hand,J6--CMhcCfQ
211260,214260,and turn it into the malevolent sensation,J6--CMhcCfQ
214260,216260,of the touch of the flame?,J6--CMhcCfQ
216260,219260,Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body,J6--CMhcCfQ
219260,221260,is hardwired like your house.,J6--CMhcCfQ
221260,223260,"In your house, wires run in the wall,",J6--CMhcCfQ
223260,226260,from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling,J6--CMhcCfQ
226260,229260,and from the junction box to the light bulb.,J6--CMhcCfQ
229260,231260,"And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.",J6--CMhcCfQ
231260,234260,"And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.",J6--CMhcCfQ
234260,238260,So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.,J6--CMhcCfQ
238260,240260,"If you hit your thumb with a hammer,",J6--CMhcCfQ
240260,243260,"these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves --",J6--CMhcCfQ
243260,246260,transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord,J6--CMhcCfQ
246260,248260,"where new wires, new nerves,",J6--CMhcCfQ
248260,250260,take the information up to the brain,J6--CMhcCfQ
250260,254260,where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.,J6--CMhcCfQ
254260,256260,"But the situation, of course, in the human body",J6--CMhcCfQ
256260,259260,is far more complicated than that.,J6--CMhcCfQ
259260,261260,Instead of it being the case,J6--CMhcCfQ
261260,263260,that that junction box in the spinal cord,J6--CMhcCfQ
263260,266260,is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve,J6--CMhcCfQ
266260,268260,by releasing these little brown packets,J6--CMhcCfQ
268260,271260,of chemical information called neurotransmitters,J6--CMhcCfQ
271260,274260,"in a linear one-on-one fashion,",J6--CMhcCfQ
274260,276260,"in fact, what happens",J6--CMhcCfQ
276260,278260,is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions --,J6--CMhcCfQ
278260,281260,"laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord --",J6--CMhcCfQ
281260,283260,and they start interacting,J6--CMhcCfQ
283260,286260,with other adjacent cells.,J6--CMhcCfQ
286260,288260,"These cells, called glial cells,",J6--CMhcCfQ
288260,290260,were once thought to be,J6--CMhcCfQ
290260,292260,unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord,J6--CMhcCfQ
292260,294260,"that did nothing more than hold all the important things together,",J6--CMhcCfQ
294260,296260,like the nerves.,J6--CMhcCfQ
296260,298260,But it turns out,J6--CMhcCfQ
298260,300260,the glial cells have a vital role,J6--CMhcCfQ
300260,302260,"in the modulation, amplification",J6--CMhcCfQ
302260,305260,"and, in the case of pain, the distortion",J6--CMhcCfQ
305260,308260,of sensory experiences.,J6--CMhcCfQ
308260,310260,These glial cells become activated.,J6--CMhcCfQ
310260,312260,"Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins,",J6--CMhcCfQ
312260,314260,which spill out,J6--CMhcCfQ
314260,316260,"and interact with adjacent nerves,",J6--CMhcCfQ
316260,319260,"and they start releasing their neurotransmitters,",J6--CMhcCfQ
319260,321260,and those neurotransmitters spill out,J6--CMhcCfQ
321260,324260,"and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth,",J6--CMhcCfQ
324260,326260,until what we have,J6--CMhcCfQ
326260,328260,is a positive feedback loop.,J6--CMhcCfQ
328260,330260,It's almost as if somebody came into your home,J6--CMhcCfQ
330260,332260,and rewired your walls,J6--CMhcCfQ
332260,334260,"so that the next time you turned on the light switch,",J6--CMhcCfQ
334260,336260,"the toilet flushed three doors down,",J6--CMhcCfQ
336260,338260,"or your dishwasher went on,",J6--CMhcCfQ
338260,340260,or your computer monitor turned off.,J6--CMhcCfQ
340260,342260,"That's crazy,",J6--CMhcCfQ
342260,344260,"but that's, in fact, what happens",J6--CMhcCfQ
344260,346260,with chronic pain.,J6--CMhcCfQ
346260,349260,And that's why pain becomes its own disease.,J6--CMhcCfQ
349260,351260,The nervous system has plasticity.,J6--CMhcCfQ
351260,353260,"It changes, and it morphs",J6--CMhcCfQ
353260,355260,in response to stimuli.,J6--CMhcCfQ
355260,357260,"Well, what do we do about that?",J6--CMhcCfQ
357260,360260,What can we do in a case like Chandler's?,J6--CMhcCfQ
360260,362260,We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion,J6--CMhcCfQ
362260,364260,at this point in time.,J6--CMhcCfQ
364260,367260,We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs --,J6--CMhcCfQ
367260,369260,painkillers --,J6--CMhcCfQ
369260,371260,"which are, frankly, not very effective",J6--CMhcCfQ
371260,373260,for this kind of pain.,J6--CMhcCfQ
373260,375260,We take nerves that are noisy and active,J6--CMhcCfQ
375260,377260,"that should be quiet,",J6--CMhcCfQ
377260,379260,and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.,J6--CMhcCfQ
379260,382260,"And most importantly, what we do",J6--CMhcCfQ
382260,386260,"is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process",J6--CMhcCfQ
386260,389260,of physical therapy and occupational therapy,J6--CMhcCfQ
389260,392260,to retrain the nerves in the nervous system,J6--CMhcCfQ
392260,395260,to respond normally,J6--CMhcCfQ
395260,398260,to the activities and sensory experiences,J6--CMhcCfQ
398260,400260,that are part of everyday life.,J6--CMhcCfQ
400260,402260,And we support all of that,J6--CMhcCfQ
402260,405260,with an intensive psychotherapy program,J6--CMhcCfQ
405260,408260,"to address the despondency, despair and depression",J6--CMhcCfQ
408260,410260,that always accompanies,J6--CMhcCfQ
410260,412260,"severe, chronic pain.",J6--CMhcCfQ
412260,414260,"It's successful,",J6--CMhcCfQ
414260,416260,"as you can see from this video of Chandler,",J6--CMhcCfQ
416260,418260,"who, two months after we first met her,",J6--CMhcCfQ
418260,420260,is now doings a back flip.,J6--CMhcCfQ
420260,422260,And I had lunch with her yesterday,J6--CMhcCfQ
422260,425260,"because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here,",J6--CMhcCfQ
425260,427260,and she's doing absolutely fantastic.,J6--CMhcCfQ
427260,431260,But the future is actually even brighter.,J6--CMhcCfQ
431260,434260,The future holds the promise,J6--CMhcCfQ
434260,436260,that new drugs will be developed,J6--CMhcCfQ
436260,439260,that are not symptom-modifying drugs,J6--CMhcCfQ
439260,441260,"that simply mask the problem,",J6--CMhcCfQ
441260,443260,"as we have now,",J6--CMhcCfQ
443260,446260,but that will be disease-modifying drugs,J6--CMhcCfQ
446260,448260,that will actually go right to the root of the problem,J6--CMhcCfQ
448260,450260,"and attack those glial cells,",J6--CMhcCfQ
450260,452260,or those pernicious proteins,J6--CMhcCfQ
452260,455260,"that the glial cells elaborate,",J6--CMhcCfQ
455260,458260,"that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up,",J6--CMhcCfQ
458260,460260,"or plasticity,",J6--CMhcCfQ
460260,462260,that so is capable,J6--CMhcCfQ
462260,464260,of distorting and amplifying,J6--CMhcCfQ
464260,466260,the sensory experience that we call pain.,J6--CMhcCfQ
466260,468260,So I have hope,J6--CMhcCfQ
468260,470260,"that in the future,",J6--CMhcCfQ
470260,473260,"the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized,",J6--CMhcCfQ
473260,475260,"who said, My philosophy:""",J6--CMhcCfQ
475260,478260,"No pain, no pain.""
196;479260;481260;Thank you very much.""",J6--CMhcCfQ
481260,487260,(Applause),J6--CMhcCfQ
18330,22330,"My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning",57eeP31s-Rs
22330,24330,"about my project, Tidying Up Art.",57eeP31s-Rs
24330,29330,First of all -- any questions so far?,57eeP31s-Rs
29330,32330,"First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.",57eeP31s-Rs
32330,36330,"I'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?",57eeP31s-Rs
36330,41330,"I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous",57eeP31s-Rs
41330,44330,"because I'm speaking in a foreign language,",57eeP31s-Rs
44330,48330,"and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.",57eeP31s-Rs
48330,53330,"Because I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German",57eeP31s-Rs
53330,55330,I'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like,57eeP31s-Rs
55330,58330,if we Swiss try to speak American.,57eeP31s-Rs
58330,61330,"But don't worry -- I don't have trouble with English, as such.",57eeP31s-Rs
61330,65330,"I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.",57eeP31s-Rs
65330,67330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
67330,71330,"I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,",57eeP31s-Rs
71330,74330,and you have to go on talking like this all the time.,57eeP31s-Rs
74330,78330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
78330,81330,So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.,57eeP31s-Rs
81330,84330,"It's called Tidying Up Art"" and it's, as you can see,""",57eeP31s-Rs
84330,87330,it's more or less a picture book.,57eeP31s-Rs
87330,91330,So the reading would be over very quickly.,57eeP31s-Rs
91330,97330,"But since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,",57eeP31s-Rs
97330,101330,"in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.",57eeP31s-Rs
101330,105330,"I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know --",57eeP31s-Rs
105330,107330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
107330,110330,"Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better.",57eeP31s-Rs
110330,115330,"So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.",57eeP31s-Rs
115330,117330,You won't be familiar with it.,57eeP31s-Rs
117330,122330,"I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years,",57eeP31s-Rs
122330,127330,"and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler",57eeP31s-Rs
127330,130330,I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day,57eeP31s-Rs
130330,134330,and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore,57eeP31s-Rs
134330,137330,this guy was looking at all day long.,57eeP31s-Rs
137330,140330,"Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.",57eeP31s-Rs
140330,142330,And it seemed to me even he felt really bad,57eeP31s-Rs
142330,146330,facing these unorganized red squares day after day.,57eeP31s-Rs
146330,148330,"So I decided to give him a little support,",57eeP31s-Rs
148330,153330,and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.,57eeP31s-Rs
153330,156330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
156330,160330,Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.,57eeP31s-Rs
160330,166330,"And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely",57eeP31s-Rs
166330,171330,"at modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art",57eeP31s-Rs
171330,173330,is particularly topsy-turvy.,57eeP31s-Rs
173330,176330,And I can show here a very good example.,57eeP31s-Rs
176330,179330,"It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.",57eeP31s-Rs
179330,182330,It's a picture by Paul Klee.,57eeP31s-Rs
182330,186330,"And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.",57eeP31s-Rs
186330,188330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
188330,194330,Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.,57eeP31s-Rs
194330,197330,The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture --,57eeP31s-Rs
197330,198330,the whole thing is unstructured.,57eeP31s-Rs
198330,202330,"We don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean --",57eeP31s-Rs
202330,204330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
204330,207330,"-- maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.",57eeP31s-Rs
207330,210330,"We can see here he started out with orange,",57eeP31s-Rs
210330,213330,"and then he already ran out of orange,",57eeP31s-Rs
213330,217330,and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.,57eeP31s-Rs
217330,220330,And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.,57eeP31s-Rs
220330,225330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
225330,229330,We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:,57eeP31s-Rs
229330,236330,17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.,57eeP31s-Rs
236330,237330,"Yeah, that's great.",57eeP31s-Rs
237330,243330,"So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.",57eeP31s-Rs
243330,246330,I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.,57eeP31s-Rs
246330,251330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
251330,252330,What can you say? What a mess.,57eeP31s-Rs
252330,259330,"I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.",57eeP31s-Rs
259330,262330,"If my room back home had looked like this,",57eeP31s-Rs
262330,264330,my mother would have grounded me for three days.,57eeP31s-Rs
264330,269330,So I'd like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.,57eeP31s-Rs
269330,274330,And that's really advanced tidying up.,57eeP31s-Rs
274330,277330,(Applause),57eeP31s-Rs
277330,279330,"Yeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point,",57eeP31s-Rs
279330,282330,but that's actually more in Switzerland.,57eeP31s-Rs
282330,287330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
287330,291330,We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.,57eeP31s-Rs
291330,294330,We are only happy when things are in order.,57eeP31s-Rs
294330,298330,"But to go on, here is a very good example to see.",57eeP31s-Rs
298330,301330,This is a picture by Joan Miro.,57eeP31s-Rs
301330,306330,"And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes",57eeP31s-Rs
306330,310330,and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.,57eeP31s-Rs
310330,313330,"And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.",57eeP31s-Rs
313330,316330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
316330,317330,And this is my --,57eeP31s-Rs
317330,320330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
320330,324330,-- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.,57eeP31s-Rs
324330,327330,It's more economical and also more efficient.,57eeP31s-Rs
327330,331330,With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.,57eeP31s-Rs
331330,335330,But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.,57eeP31s-Rs
335330,339330,"So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,",57eeP31s-Rs

415330,417330,"One, two, three.",57eeP31s-Rs

426330,430330,"You can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic way",57eeP31s-Rs
430330,433330,can sometimes lead to complete chaos.,57eeP31s-Rs
433330,437330,So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.,57eeP31s-Rs
437330,442330,"This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.",57eeP31s-Rs
442330,447330,"And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see",57eeP31s-Rs
447330,452330,what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.,57eeP31s-Rs

495330,498330,This is Keith Haring looked at statistically.,57eeP31s-Rs
498330,500330,"One can see here quite clearly,",57eeP31s-Rs
500330,504330,"you can see we have 25 pale green elements,",57eeP31s-Rs
504330,506330,of which one is in the form of a circle.,57eeP31s-Rs
506330,511330,"Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.",57eeP31s-Rs
511330,515330,"I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis",57eeP31s-Rs
515330,517330,"to cover all Mr. Haring's various works,",57eeP31s-Rs
517330,523330,in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.,57eeP31s-Rs
523330,527330,And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure,57eeP31s-Rs
527330,532330,by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.,57eeP31s-Rs
532330,533330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
533330,536330,One can obviously also make combinations.,57eeP31s-Rs
536330,540330,"For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.",57eeP31s-Rs
540330,542330,You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.,57eeP31s-Rs
542330,545330,"In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.",57eeP31s-Rs

549330,555330,put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.,57eeP31s-Rs
555330,557330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
557330,559330,"Yeah, from my own experience. So I'm --",57eeP31s-Rs
559330,562330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
562330,567330,"Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.",57eeP31s-Rs
567330,572330,This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.,57eeP31s-Rs
572330,574330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
574330,578330,But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.,57eeP31s-Rs
578330,582330,And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.,57eeP31s-Rs
582330,588330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
588330,591330,"And here, that's one of my favorites.",57eeP31s-Rs
591330,594330,Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun.,57eeP31s-Rs
594330,595330,"You know, there is a --",57eeP31s-Rs
595330,597330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
597330,601330,I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.,57eeP31s-Rs
601330,604330,It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.,57eeP31s-Rs
604330,608330,"So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.",57eeP31s-Rs
608330,610330,"And you know, there you had this little sign --",57eeP31s-Rs
610330,616330,"I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,",57eeP31s-Rs
616330,619330,"Please tidy room."" I don't know if you have them over here.""",57eeP31s-Rs
619330,625330,"So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.",57eeP31s-Rs
625330,628330,"So after a while I decided to have a little fun,",57eeP31s-Rs
628330,633330,and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.,57eeP31s-Rs
633330,637330,"Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.",57eeP31s-Rs
637330,641330,By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.,57eeP31s-Rs
641330,649330,"But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.",57eeP31s-Rs
649330,651330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
651330,657330,And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.,57eeP31s-Rs
657330,660330,And when I returned it looked like this.,57eeP31s-Rs
660330,667330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
667330,669330,"Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.",57eeP31s-Rs
669330,672330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
672330,674330,"OK, I mean, I can see there are always people",57eeP31s-Rs
674330,678330,that like reacting that one or another picture,57eeP31s-Rs
678330,683330,hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.,57eeP31s-Rs
683330,685330,"This is a picture by Rene Magritte,",57eeP31s-Rs
685330,689330,"and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is --",57eeP31s-Rs
689330,695330,to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.,57eeP31s-Rs
695330,697330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
697330,702330,Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.,57eeP31s-Rs
702330,706330,Some people would make apple pie out of it.,57eeP31s-Rs
706330,708330,But it's a very good example to see that the whole work,57eeP31s-Rs
708330,713330,was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job,57eeP31s-Rs
713330,719330,of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.,57eeP31s-Rs
719330,722330,"And it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,",57eeP31s-Rs
722330,726330,otherwise it would look like this.,57eeP31s-Rs
726330,731330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
731330,737330,So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time.,57eeP31s-Rs
737330,740330,"Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.",57eeP31s-Rs
740330,745330,"It's -- oh, no, it's -- that's a really hard one.",57eeP31s-Rs
745330,750330,"But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way",57eeP31s-Rs
750330,753330,and put the paint back into the cans.,57eeP31s-Rs
753330,763330,(Applause),57eeP31s-Rs
763330,768330,Or you could go into three-dimensional art.,57eeP31s-Rs
768330,773330,Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.,57eeP31s-Rs
773330,776330,Here I just brought it back to its original state.,57eeP31s-Rs
776330,784330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
784330,789330,"But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know --",57eeP31s-Rs
789330,795330,Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.,57eeP31s-Rs
795330,797330,The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings,57eeP31s-Rs
798330,801330,where everything is broken down into dots and pixels.,57eeP31s-Rs
801330,805330,And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.,57eeP31s-Rs
805330,808330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
808330,812330,"So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat,",57eeP31s-Rs
812330,814330,and I collected together all his dots.,57eeP31s-Rs
814330,816330,And now they're all in here.,57eeP31s-Rs
816330,821330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
821330,822330,"You can count them afterwards, if you like.",57eeP31s-Rs
822330,827330,"You see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:",57eeP31s-Rs
827330,830330,it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it.,57eeP31s-Rs
830330,834330,"There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.",57eeP31s-Rs
834330,838330,"I mean, it's the future we will create.""""",57eeP31s-Rs
838330,840330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
840330,845330,But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.,57eeP31s-Rs
845330,848330,This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.,57eeP31s-Rs
848330,851330,That's how it looks like when you send everyone home.,57eeP31s-Rs
851330,862330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
862330,864330,"Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves",57eeP31s-Rs
864330,868330,where old Bruegel's people went?,57eeP31s-Rs
868330,872330,"Of course, they're not gone. They're all here.",57eeP31s-Rs
872330,873330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
873330,875330,I just piled them up.,57eeP31s-Rs
875330,879330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
879330,883330,"So I'm -- yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.",57eeP31s-Rs
883330,888330,"And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.",57eeP31s-Rs
889330,892330,And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.,57eeP31s-Rs
894330,896330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
896330,900330,"But before leaving I would like to show you,",57eeP31s-Rs
900330,905330,I'm working right now on another -- in a related field,57eeP31s-Rs
905330,908330,with my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field.,57eeP31s-Rs

935330,938330,(Laughter),57eeP31s-Rs
938330,944330,"Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly,",57eeP31s-Rs
944330,948330,so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.,57eeP31s-Rs

172260,174260,they are in the same position.,nItwVO9stX8

192260,195260,"when the mobile phone, the burger, the telephone,",nItwVO9stX8
195260,197260,"everything has its own personal identity,",nItwVO9stX8
197260,199260,how should we perceive ourselves,nItwVO9stX8
199260,201260,and how should we perceive others?,nItwVO9stX8
201260,204260,How does that impact our desert culture?,nItwVO9stX8
204260,207260,I'm not sure of how many of you in Washington,nItwVO9stX8
207260,210260,are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region,nItwVO9stX8
210260,212260,"and, the more recent, Museum of Islamic Art",nItwVO9stX8
212260,215260,opened in Qatar in 2008.,nItwVO9stX8
215260,218260,"I myself am personalizing these cultural developments,",nItwVO9stX8
218260,220260,but I also understand,nItwVO9stX8
220260,222260,that this has to be done organically.,nItwVO9stX8
222260,225260,"Yes, we do have all the resources that we need",nItwVO9stX8
225260,228260,"in order to develop new cultural institutions,",nItwVO9stX8
228260,230260,but what I think is more important,nItwVO9stX8
230260,232260,is that we are very fortunate,nItwVO9stX8
232260,234260,to have visionary leaders,nItwVO9stX8
234260,236260,"who understand that this can't happen from outside,",nItwVO9stX8
236260,238260,it has to come from within.,nItwVO9stX8
238260,240260,And guess what?,nItwVO9stX8
240260,243260,You might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf,nItwVO9stX8
243260,245260,who are leading these cultural initiatives,nItwVO9stX8
245260,247260,happen to be women.,nItwVO9stX8
247260,250260,"I want to ask you, why do you think this is?",nItwVO9stX8
250260,252260,Is it because it's a soft option;,nItwVO9stX8
252260,254260,we have nothing else to do?,nItwVO9stX8
254260,256260,"No, I don't think so.",nItwVO9stX8
256260,259260,I think that women in this part of the world,nItwVO9stX8
259260,261260,realize that culture is an important component,nItwVO9stX8
261260,263260,to connect people,nItwVO9stX8
263260,265260,both locally and regionally.,nItwVO9stX8
265260,267260,It's a natural component,nItwVO9stX8
267260,270260,"for bringing people together, discussing ideas --",nItwVO9stX8
270260,272260,in the same way we're doing here at TED.,nItwVO9stX8
272260,274260,"We're here, we're part of a community,",nItwVO9stX8
274260,277260,sharing out ideas and discussing them.,nItwVO9stX8
277260,279260,Art becomes a very important part,nItwVO9stX8
279260,281260,of our national identity.,nItwVO9stX8
281260,285260,The existential and social and political impact,nItwVO9stX8
285260,287260,an artist has,nItwVO9stX8
287260,289260,on his nation's development of cultural identity,nItwVO9stX8
289260,291260,is very important.,nItwVO9stX8
291260,293260,"You know, art and culture is big business.",nItwVO9stX8
293260,295260,Ask me.,nItwVO9stX8
295260,297260,Ask the chairpersons and CEOs,nItwVO9stX8
297260,299260,of Sotheby's and Christie's.,nItwVO9stX8
299260,302260,Ask Charles Saatchi about great art.,nItwVO9stX8
302260,304260,They make a lot of money.,nItwVO9stX8
304260,306260,So I think women in our society,nItwVO9stX8
306260,308260,"are becoming leaders,",nItwVO9stX8
308260,310260,because they realize,nItwVO9stX8
310260,312260,"that for their future generations,",nItwVO9stX8
312260,314260,it's very important,nItwVO9stX8
314260,316260,to maintain our cultural identities.,nItwVO9stX8
316260,318260,Why else do Greeks demand the return,nItwVO9stX8
318260,320260,of the Elgin Marbles?,nItwVO9stX8
320260,322260,And why is there an uproar,nItwVO9stX8
322260,324260,when a private collector tries to sell his collection,nItwVO9stX8
324260,326260,to a foreign museum?,nItwVO9stX8
326260,328260,Why does it take me months on end,nItwVO9stX8
328260,331260,to get an export license from London or New York,nItwVO9stX8
331260,334260,in order to get pieces into my country?,nItwVO9stX8
334260,337260,"In few hours, Shirin Neshat, my friend from Iran",nItwVO9stX8
337260,340260,who's a very important artist for us,nItwVO9stX8

342260,345260,"She lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist.",nItwVO9stX8
345260,347260,"Instead, she tries to engage",nItwVO9stX8
347260,349260,in a very important dialogue,nItwVO9stX8
349260,351260,"about her culture, nation and heritage.",nItwVO9stX8
351260,354260,She does that through important visual forms,nItwVO9stX8
354260,356260,of photography and film.,nItwVO9stX8
356260,360260,"In the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums",nItwVO9stX8
360260,363260,through an organic process from within.,nItwVO9stX8
363260,366260,Our mission is of cultural integration and independence.,nItwVO9stX8
366260,368260,We don't want to have what there is in the West.,nItwVO9stX8

370260,373260,"We want to build our own identities, our own fabric,",nItwVO9stX8
373260,375260,create an open dialogue,nItwVO9stX8
375260,377260,so that we share our ideas,nItwVO9stX8
377260,379260,and share yours with us.,nItwVO9stX8
379260,381260,"In a few days,",nItwVO9stX8
381260,384260,we will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art.,nItwVO9stX8
384260,386260,We have done extensive research,nItwVO9stX8
386260,388260,"to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists,",nItwVO9stX8
388260,390260,and Arabs who are not Muslims --,nItwVO9stX8
390260,392260,"not all Arabs are Muslims, by the way --",nItwVO9stX8
392260,394260,but we make sure that they are represented,nItwVO9stX8
394260,397260,in this new institution.,nItwVO9stX8
397260,399260,This institution is government-backed,nItwVO9stX8
399260,401260,and it has been the case,nItwVO9stX8
401260,403260,for the past three decades.,nItwVO9stX8
403260,405260,"We will open the museum in a few days,",nItwVO9stX8
405260,408260,and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways,nItwVO9stX8
408260,410260,and come and join us.,nItwVO9stX8
410260,412260,(Laughter),nItwVO9stX8
412260,416260,Now this museum is just as important to us as the West.,nItwVO9stX8
416260,418260,Some of you might have heard,nItwVO9stX8
418260,421260,"of the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine,",nItwVO9stX8
421260,423260,but I doubt a lot of people know,nItwVO9stX8
423260,426260,that this artist worked in Picasso's studio,nItwVO9stX8
426260,428260,in Paris in the 1930s.,nItwVO9stX8
428260,430260,For me it was a new discovery.,nItwVO9stX8
430260,433260,"And I think with time, in the years to come",nItwVO9stX8
433260,435260,"we'll be learning a lot about our Picassos,",nItwVO9stX8

439260,442260,but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet.,nItwVO9stX8
442260,445260,Now visual expression is just one form,nItwVO9stX8
445260,448260,of culture integration.,nItwVO9stX8
448260,450260,We have realized that recently,nItwVO9stX8
450260,452260,more and more people,nItwVO9stX8
452260,455260,are using the means of YouTube and social networking,nItwVO9stX8
455260,458260,"to express their stories, share their photos",nItwVO9stX8
458260,460260,and tell their own stories through their own voices.,nItwVO9stX8
460260,462260,"In a similar way,",nItwVO9stX8
462260,464260,we have created the Doha Film Institute.,nItwVO9stX8
464260,467260,Now the Doha Film Institute is an organization,nItwVO9stX8
467260,470260,to teach people about film and filmmaking.,nItwVO9stX8
470260,473260,Last year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker.,nItwVO9stX8
473260,475260,Today I am proud to say,nItwVO9stX8
475260,477260,we have trained and educated,nItwVO9stX8
477260,479260,over 66 Qatari women filmmakers,nItwVO9stX8

489260,492260,"Now if you'll allow me, I would love to share a one-minute film",nItwVO9stX8
492260,494260,that has proven to show,nItwVO9stX8
494260,497260,that a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku,nItwVO9stX8
497260,499260,in telling a big picture.,nItwVO9stX8
499260,502260,And this is one of our filmmakers' products.,nItwVO9stX8

42260,44260,But I'll tell you some of that today.,PcDftBVDSlc
44260,46260,That also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction,PcDftBVDSlc
46260,48260,that we do from the ocean.,PcDftBVDSlc
48260,50260,That's about 10 percent of our global needs,PcDftBVDSlc

69260,71260,the things that live in the deep ocean.,PcDftBVDSlc
71260,74260,"And eventually, the deep sea floor would come into view.",PcDftBVDSlc
74260,77260,This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface,PcDftBVDSlc

88260,90260,from those bodies.,PcDftBVDSlc
90260,92260,"And so 10 years ago,",PcDftBVDSlc
92260,95260,"an international program began called the Census of Marine Life,",PcDftBVDSlc

104260,107260,And I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage,PcDftBVDSlc
107260,109260,that it managed to achieve.,PcDftBVDSlc
109260,111260,"It all began when two scientists, Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel,",PcDftBVDSlc
111260,114260,"met in Woods Hole, Massachusetts",PcDftBVDSlc
114260,116260,where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute.,PcDftBVDSlc
116260,119260,And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity,PcDftBVDSlc
119260,122260,and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it.,PcDftBVDSlc
122260,124260,"Well, from that discussion grew this program",PcDftBVDSlc
124260,126260,"that involved 2,700 scientists",PcDftBVDSlc
126260,128260,from more than 80 countries around the world,PcDftBVDSlc
128260,131260,who engaged in 540 ocean expeditions,PcDftBVDSlc
131260,134260,at a combined cost of 650 million dollars,PcDftBVDSlc
134260,136260,"to study the distribution, diversity and abundance",PcDftBVDSlc
136260,139260,of life in the global ocean.,PcDftBVDSlc
139260,141260,And so what did we find?,PcDftBVDSlc
141260,143260,"We found spectacular new species,",PcDftBVDSlc
143260,146260,the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked --,PcDftBVDSlc
146260,148260,"from the shoreline to the abyss,",PcDftBVDSlc
148260,151260,form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between.,PcDftBVDSlc
151260,154260,"And the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life,",PcDftBVDSlc
154260,156260,but rather the taxonomic specialists,PcDftBVDSlc
156260,158260,who can identify and catalog these species,PcDftBVDSlc
158260,160260,that became the limiting step.,PcDftBVDSlc
160260,163260,"They, in fact, are an endangered species themselves.",PcDftBVDSlc
163260,165260,There are actually four to five new species,PcDftBVDSlc
165260,167260,described everyday for the oceans.,PcDftBVDSlc
167260,170260,"And as I say, it could be a much larger number.",PcDftBVDSlc
170260,173260,"Now, I come from Newfoundland in Canada --",PcDftBVDSlc
173260,175260,It's an island off the east coast of that continent --,PcDftBVDSlc
175260,178260,where we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters,PcDftBVDSlc
178260,180260,in human history.,PcDftBVDSlc
180260,182260,And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish.,PcDftBVDSlc
182260,184260,It's around 1900.,PcDftBVDSlc
184260,186260,"Now, when I was a boy of about his age,",PcDftBVDSlc
186260,188260,I would go out fishing with my grandfather,PcDftBVDSlc
188260,190260,and we would catch fish about half that size.,PcDftBVDSlc
190260,192260,"And I thought that was the norm,",PcDftBVDSlc
192260,194260,because I had never seen fish like this.,PcDftBVDSlc
194260,197260,"If you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed,",PcDftBVDSlc
197260,200260,"if you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge,",PcDftBVDSlc
200260,202260,it would be half that size still.,PcDftBVDSlc
202260,205260,So what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines.,PcDftBVDSlc
205260,207260,Our expectations of what the oceans can produce,PcDftBVDSlc
207260,209260,is something that we don't really appreciate,PcDftBVDSlc
209260,212260,because we haven't seen it in our lifetimes.,PcDftBVDSlc
212260,215260,"Now most of us, and I would say me included,",PcDftBVDSlc
215260,217260,think that human exploitation of the oceans,PcDftBVDSlc
217260,219260,really only became very serious,PcDftBVDSlc
219260,221260,"in the last 50 to, perhaps, 100 years or so.",PcDftBVDSlc
221260,223260,"The census actually tried to look back in time,",PcDftBVDSlc
223260,226260,using every source of information they could get their hands on.,PcDftBVDSlc
226260,228260,And so anything from restaurant menus,PcDftBVDSlc
228260,230260,to monastery records to ships' logs,PcDftBVDSlc
230260,232260,to see what the oceans looked like.,PcDftBVDSlc
232260,234260,Because science data really goes back,PcDftBVDSlc
234260,236260,"to, at best, World War II, for the most part.",PcDftBVDSlc
236260,238260,"And so what they found, in fact,",PcDftBVDSlc
238260,240260,is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans.,PcDftBVDSlc
240260,243260,"And so at that time, of course, there was no refrigeration.",PcDftBVDSlc
243260,245260,So fishermen could only catch,PcDftBVDSlc
245260,247260,what they could either eat or sell that day.,PcDftBVDSlc
247260,249260,But the Romans developed salting.,PcDftBVDSlc
249260,251260,"And with salting,",PcDftBVDSlc
251260,254260,it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances.,PcDftBVDSlc
254260,257260,And so began industrial fishing.,PcDftBVDSlc
257260,260260,And so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have,PcDftBVDSlc
260260,262260,of what sort of loss we've had,PcDftBVDSlc
262260,265260,relative to pre-human impacts on the ocean.,PcDftBVDSlc
265260,267260,They range from 65 to 98 percent,PcDftBVDSlc
267260,269260,"for these major groups of organisms,",PcDftBVDSlc
269260,271260,as shown in the dark blue bars.,PcDftBVDSlc
271260,274260,"Now for those species the we managed to leave alone, that we protect --",PcDftBVDSlc
274260,276260,"for example, marine mammals in recent years and sea birds --",PcDftBVDSlc
276260,278260,there is some recovery.,PcDftBVDSlc
278260,280260,So it's not all hopeless.,PcDftBVDSlc
280260,283260,"But for the most part, we've gone from salting to exhausting.",PcDftBVDSlc
283260,285260,Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.,PcDftBVDSlc
285260,288260,It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida.,PcDftBVDSlc
288260,291260,And so this is a photograph from the 1950s.,PcDftBVDSlc
291260,293260,"I want you to notice the scale on the slide,",PcDftBVDSlc
293260,295260,"because when you see the same picture from the 1980s,",PcDftBVDSlc
295260,297260,we see the fish are much smaller,PcDftBVDSlc
297260,299260,and we're also seeing a change,PcDftBVDSlc
299260,301260,in terms of the composition of those fish.,PcDftBVDSlc
301260,303260,"By 2007, the catch was actually laughable",PcDftBVDSlc
303260,305260,in terms of the size for a trophy fish.,PcDftBVDSlc
305260,307260,But this is no laughing matter.,PcDftBVDSlc
307260,309260,The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity,PcDftBVDSlc
309260,312260,and we're responsible for it.,PcDftBVDSlc
312260,314260,So what's left? Actually quite a lot.,PcDftBVDSlc
314260,317260,"There's a lot of exciting things, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them.",PcDftBVDSlc
317260,319260,"And I want to start with a bit on technology,",PcDftBVDSlc
319260,321260,"because, of course, this is a TED Conference",PcDftBVDSlc
321260,323260,and you want to hear something on technology.,PcDftBVDSlc
323260,325260,So one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean,PcDftBVDSlc
325260,327260,are remotely operated vehicles.,PcDftBVDSlc
327260,330260,So these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor,PcDftBVDSlc
330260,333260,where they're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom.,PcDftBVDSlc
333260,336260,"So a couple of years ago, I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise",PcDftBVDSlc
336260,339260,and I couldn't go because of a scheduling conflict.,PcDftBVDSlc
339260,342260,But through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home,PcDftBVDSlc
342260,345260,"with my dog curled up at my feet, a cup of tea in my hand,",PcDftBVDSlc
345260,347260,"and I could tell the pilot, I want a sample right there.""""",PcDftBVDSlc
347260,349260,And that's exactly what the pilot did for me.,PcDftBVDSlc
349260,352260,That's the sort of technology that's available today,PcDftBVDSlc
352260,354260,that really wasn't available even a decade ago.,PcDftBVDSlc
354260,356260,So it allows us to sample these amazing habitats,PcDftBVDSlc
356260,358260,that are very far from the surface,PcDftBVDSlc
358260,360260,and very far from light.,PcDftBVDSlc
360260,363260,And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans,PcDftBVDSlc
363260,365260,"is acoustics, or sound waves.",PcDftBVDSlc
365260,367260,And the advantage of sound waves,PcDftBVDSlc
367260,369260,"is that they actually pass well through water, unlike light.",PcDftBVDSlc
369260,371260,"And so we can send out sound waves,",PcDftBVDSlc
371260,374260,they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back.,PcDftBVDSlc
374260,377260,"And so in this example, a census scientist took out two ships.",PcDftBVDSlc
377260,379260,One would send out sound waves that would bounce back.,PcDftBVDSlc
379260,381260,"They would be received by a second ship,",PcDftBVDSlc
381260,384260,"and that would give us very precise estimates, in this case,",PcDftBVDSlc
384260,386260,of 250 billion herring,PcDftBVDSlc
386260,388260,in a period of about a minute.,PcDftBVDSlc
388260,391260,And that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island.,PcDftBVDSlc
391260,393260,"And to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool,",PcDftBVDSlc
393260,396260,because knowing how many fish are there is really critical.,PcDftBVDSlc
396260,398260,We can also use satellite tags,PcDftBVDSlc
398260,400260,to track animals as they move through the oceans.,PcDftBVDSlc
400260,402260,"And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe,",PcDftBVDSlc
402260,404260,"such as this elephant seal,",PcDftBVDSlc
404260,406260,it's an opportunity to send data back to shore,PcDftBVDSlc
406260,409260,and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean.,PcDftBVDSlc
409260,411260,And so from that we can produce these tracks.,PcDftBVDSlc
411260,413260,"For example, the dark blue",PcDftBVDSlc
413260,415260,shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific.,PcDftBVDSlc
415260,418260,"Now I realize for those of you who are colorblind, this slide is not very helpful,",PcDftBVDSlc
418260,420260,but stick with me nonetheless.,PcDftBVDSlc
420260,422260,"For animals that don't surface,",PcDftBVDSlc
422260,424260,"we have something called pop-up tags,",PcDftBVDSlc
424260,427260,which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets.,PcDftBVDSlc
427260,429260,And then at some period of time,PcDftBVDSlc
429260,432260,"it pops up to the surface and, again, relays that data back to shore.",PcDftBVDSlc
432260,435260,Because GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools.,PcDftBVDSlc
435260,438260,"And so from this we're able to identify these blue highways,",PcDftBVDSlc
438260,440260,"these hot spots in the ocean,",PcDftBVDSlc
440260,442260,that should be real priority areas,PcDftBVDSlc
442260,444260,for ocean conservation.,PcDftBVDSlc
444260,446260,Now one of the other things that you may think about,PcDftBVDSlc
446260,449260,"is that, when you go to the supermarket and you buy things, they're scanned.",PcDftBVDSlc
449260,451260,And so there's a barcode on that product,PcDftBVDSlc
451260,454260,that tells the computer exactly what the product is.,PcDftBVDSlc
454260,457260,Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding.,PcDftBVDSlc
457260,459260,And what barcoding does,PcDftBVDSlc
459260,461260,is use a specific gene called CO1,PcDftBVDSlc
461260,464260,"that's consistent within a species, but varies among species.",PcDftBVDSlc
464260,466260,And so what that means is we can unambiguously identify,PcDftBVDSlc
466260,468260,which species are which,PcDftBVDSlc
468260,470260,"even if they look similar to each other,",PcDftBVDSlc
470260,472260,but may be biologically quite different.,PcDftBVDSlc
472260,474260,Now one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this,PcDftBVDSlc
474260,477260,"is the story of two young women, high school students in New York City,",PcDftBVDSlc
477260,479260,who worked with the census.,PcDftBVDSlc
479260,482260,They went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City,PcDftBVDSlc
482260,484260,and they barcoded it.,PcDftBVDSlc
484260,486260,Well what they found was mislabeled fish.,PcDftBVDSlc
486260,488260,"So for example,",PcDftBVDSlc
488260,490260,"they found something which was sold as tuna, which is very valuable,",PcDftBVDSlc
490260,493260,"was in fact tilapia, which is a much less valuable fish.",PcDftBVDSlc
493260,495260,They also found an endangered species,PcDftBVDSlc
495260,497260,sold as a common one.,PcDftBVDSlc
497260,499260,So barcoding allows us to know what we're working with,PcDftBVDSlc
499260,502260,and also what we're eating.,PcDftBVDSlc
502260,504260,The Ocean Biogeographic Information System,PcDftBVDSlc
504260,506260,is the database for all the census data.,PcDftBVDSlc
506260,509260,It's open access; you can all go in and download data as you wish.,PcDftBVDSlc
509260,512260,And it contains all the data from the census,PcDftBVDSlc
512260,514260,plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute.,PcDftBVDSlc
514260,516260,And so what you can do with that,PcDftBVDSlc
516260,519260,is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans.,PcDftBVDSlc
519260,521260,What I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand.,PcDftBVDSlc
521260,524260,This is where our sampling effort has concentrated.,PcDftBVDSlc
524260,526260,Now what you can see,PcDftBVDSlc
526260,528260,"is we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic,",PcDftBVDSlc
528260,530260,"in the North Sea in particular,",PcDftBVDSlc
530260,532260,and also the east coast of North America fairly well.,PcDftBVDSlc
532260,535260,That's the warm colors which show a well-sampled region.,PcDftBVDSlc
535260,537260,"The cold colors, the blue and the black,",PcDftBVDSlc
537260,539260,show areas where we have almost no data.,PcDftBVDSlc
539260,541260,"So even after a 10-year census,",PcDftBVDSlc
541260,544260,there are large areas that still remain unexplored.,PcDftBVDSlc
544260,547260,"Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas, working in the Gulf of Mexico",PcDftBVDSlc
547260,549260,who decided really as a labor of love,PcDftBVDSlc
549260,551260,to pull together all the knowledge they could,PcDftBVDSlc
551260,553260,about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico.,PcDftBVDSlc
553260,556260,"And so they put this together, a list of all the species,",PcDftBVDSlc
556260,558260,"where they're known to occur,",PcDftBVDSlc
558260,561260,"and it really seemed like a very esoteric, scientific type of exercise.",PcDftBVDSlc
561260,564260,"But then, of course, there was the Deep Horizon oil spill.",PcDftBVDSlc
564260,566260,"So all of a sudden, this labor of love",PcDftBVDSlc
566260,569260,for no obvious economic reason,PcDftBVDSlc
569260,571260,has become a critical piece of information,PcDftBVDSlc
571260,574260,"in terms of how that system is going to recover, how long it will take",PcDftBVDSlc
574260,576260,and how the lawsuits,PcDftBVDSlc
576260,579260,and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years,PcDftBVDSlc
579260,582260,are likely to be resolved.,PcDftBVDSlc
582260,584260,So what did we find?,PcDftBVDSlc
584260,586260,"Well, I could stand here for hours, but, of course, I'm not allowed to do that.",PcDftBVDSlc
586260,588260,But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries,PcDftBVDSlc
588260,590260,from the census.,PcDftBVDSlc
590260,593260,So one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity?,PcDftBVDSlc
593260,596260,Where do we find the most species of ocean life?,PcDftBVDSlc
596260,598260,And what we find if we plot up the well-known species,PcDftBVDSlc
598260,600260,is this sort of a distribution.,PcDftBVDSlc
600260,602260,"And what we see is that for coastal tags,",PcDftBVDSlc
602260,604260,"for those organisms that live near the shoreline,",PcDftBVDSlc
604260,606260,they're most diverse in the tropics.,PcDftBVDSlc
606260,608260,"This is something we've actually known for a while,",PcDftBVDSlc
608260,610260,so it's not a real breakthrough.,PcDftBVDSlc
610260,612260,What is really exciting though,PcDftBVDSlc
612260,614260,"is that the oceanic tags, or the ones that live far from the coast,",PcDftBVDSlc
614260,616260,are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes.,PcDftBVDSlc
616260,619260,"This is the sort of data, again, that managers could use",PcDftBVDSlc
619260,622260,if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve.,PcDftBVDSlc
622260,625260,"You can do this on a global scale, but you can also do it on a regional scale.",PcDftBVDSlc
625260,628260,And that's why biodiversity data can be so valuable.,PcDftBVDSlc
628260,631260,Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census,PcDftBVDSlc
631260,633260,"are things that are small and hard to see,",PcDftBVDSlc
633260,635260,that certainly wasn't always the case.,PcDftBVDSlc
635260,637260,"For example, while it's hard to believe",PcDftBVDSlc
637260,639260,"that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists,",PcDftBVDSlc
639260,641260,it did until a few years ago,PcDftBVDSlc
641260,644260,when South African fishermen requested an export permit,PcDftBVDSlc
644260,647260,and scientists realized that this was something new to science.,PcDftBVDSlc
647260,649260,Similarly this Golden V kelp,PcDftBVDSlc
649260,651260,collected in Alaska just below the low water mark,PcDftBVDSlc
651260,653260,is probably a new species.,PcDftBVDSlc
653260,655260,"Even though it's three meters long,",PcDftBVDSlc
655260,657260,"it actually, again, eluded science.",PcDftBVDSlc
657260,660260,"Now this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length.",PcDftBVDSlc
660260,663260,"But to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,",PcDftBVDSlc
663260,665260,so it was a lot harder to find.,PcDftBVDSlc
665260,668260,But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.,PcDftBVDSlc
668260,671260,"This particular shrimp, we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp,",PcDftBVDSlc
671260,673260,it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago --,PcDftBVDSlc
673260,675260,"at least it was, until the census discovered",PcDftBVDSlc
675260,678260,it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia.,PcDftBVDSlc
678260,681260,"And it shows that the ocean, because of its vastness,",PcDftBVDSlc
681260,683260,can hide secrets for a very long time.,PcDftBVDSlc
683260,686260,"So, Steven Spielberg, eat your heart out.",PcDftBVDSlc
686260,689260,"If we look at distributions, in fact distributions change dramatically.",PcDftBVDSlc
689260,692260,And so one of the records that we had,PcDftBVDSlc
692260,695260,"was this sooty shearwater, which undergoes these spectacular migrations",PcDftBVDSlc
695260,697260,all the way from New Zealand,PcDftBVDSlc
697260,699260,all the way up to Alaska and back again,PcDftBVDSlc
699260,701260,in search of endless summer,PcDftBVDSlc
701260,703260,as they complete their life cycles.,PcDftBVDSlc
703260,705260,We also talked about the White Shark Cafe.,PcDftBVDSlc
705260,708260,This is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge.,PcDftBVDSlc
708260,710260,"We don't know why they converge there, we simply don't know.",PcDftBVDSlc
710260,712260,That's a question for the future.,PcDftBVDSlc
712260,714260,One of the things that we're taught in high school,PcDftBVDSlc
714260,717260,is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.,PcDftBVDSlc
717260,720260,"Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size,",PcDftBVDSlc
720260,722260,not terribly charismatic.,PcDftBVDSlc
722260,724260,But it was only discovered in the early 1980s.,PcDftBVDSlc
724260,726260,But the really interesting thing about it,PcDftBVDSlc
726260,729260,"is that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered",PcDftBVDSlc
729260,731260,that this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments,PcDftBVDSlc
731260,733260,in the deep Mediterranean Sea.,PcDftBVDSlc
733260,735260,"So now they know that, in fact,",PcDftBVDSlc
735260,737260,"animals can live without oxygen, at least some of them,",PcDftBVDSlc
737260,740260,and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions.,PcDftBVDSlc
740260,743260,"If you were to suck all the water out of the ocean,",PcDftBVDSlc
743260,745260,"this is what you'd be left behind with,",PcDftBVDSlc
745260,747260,and that's the biomass of life on the sea floor.,PcDftBVDSlc
747260,750260,Now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles,PcDftBVDSlc
750260,753260,and not much biomass in between.,PcDftBVDSlc
753260,755260,We found life in the extremes.,PcDftBVDSlc
755260,757260,And so there were new species that were found,PcDftBVDSlc
757260,759260,that live inside ice,PcDftBVDSlc
759260,761260,and help to support an ice-based food web.,PcDftBVDSlc
761260,763260,And we also found this spectacular yeti crab,PcDftBVDSlc
763260,766260,that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island.,PcDftBVDSlc
766260,768260,And this particular species,PcDftBVDSlc
768260,771260,really captured the public's attention.,PcDftBVDSlc
771260,774260,"We also found the deepest vents known yet -- 5,000 meters --",PcDftBVDSlc
774260,777260,the hottest vents at 407 degrees Celsius --,PcDftBVDSlc
777260,779260,vents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic,PcDftBVDSlc
779260,781260,where none had been found before.,PcDftBVDSlc
781260,784260,So even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable.,PcDftBVDSlc
784260,786260,"Now in terms of the unknowns, there are many.",PcDftBVDSlc
786260,788260,And I'm just going to summarize just a few of them,PcDftBVDSlc
788260,790260,very quickly for you.,PcDftBVDSlc
790260,793260,"First of all, we might ask, how many fishes in the sea?",PcDftBVDSlc
793260,795260,We actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean,PcDftBVDSlc
795260,797260,other than marine mammals.,PcDftBVDSlc
797260,800260,And so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery,PcDftBVDSlc
800260,803260,how many more species we're likely to discover.,PcDftBVDSlc
803260,805260,"And from that, we actually calculate",PcDftBVDSlc
805260,808260,"that we know about 16,500 marine species",PcDftBVDSlc
808260,810260,"and there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go.",PcDftBVDSlc
810260,812260,So we've done pretty well.,PcDftBVDSlc
812260,814260,"We've got about 75 percent of the fish,",PcDftBVDSlc
814260,816260,maybe as much as 90 percent.,PcDftBVDSlc
816260,819260,"But the fishes, as I say, are the best known.",PcDftBVDSlc
819260,822260,So our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms.,PcDftBVDSlc
822260,824260,Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper,PcDftBVDSlc
824260,827260,that's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology.,PcDftBVDSlc
827260,829260,And what is does is predict how many more species there are,PcDftBVDSlc
829260,831260,on land and in the ocean.,PcDftBVDSlc
831260,833260,And what they found,PcDftBVDSlc
833260,836260,is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean.,PcDftBVDSlc
836260,838260,"That means 91 percent, even after the census,",PcDftBVDSlc
838260,840260,still remain to be discovered.,PcDftBVDSlc
840260,842260,And so that turns out to be about two million species,PcDftBVDSlc
842260,844260,once all is said and done.,PcDftBVDSlc
844260,846260,So we still have quite a lot of work to do,PcDftBVDSlc
846260,848260,in terms of unknowns.,PcDftBVDSlc
848260,850260,Now this bacterium,PcDftBVDSlc
850260,853260,is part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile.,PcDftBVDSlc
853260,855260,And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece.,PcDftBVDSlc
855260,858260,And so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye.,PcDftBVDSlc
858260,861260,But you can imagine the biomass that represents.,PcDftBVDSlc
861260,863260,But the really intriguing thing about the microbes,PcDftBVDSlc
863260,865260,is just how diverse they are.,PcDftBVDSlc
865260,867260,A single drop of seawater,PcDftBVDSlc
867260,869260,could contain 160 different types of microbes.,PcDftBVDSlc
869260,871260,And the oceans themselves,PcDftBVDSlc
871260,874260,are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types.,PcDftBVDSlc
874260,877260,So that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there?,PcDftBVDSlc
877260,879260,We actually don't know.,PcDftBVDSlc
879260,881260,"The most exciting thing, I would say, about this census",PcDftBVDSlc
881260,883260,is the role of global science.,PcDftBVDSlc
883260,885260,"And so as we see in this image of light during the night,",PcDftBVDSlc
885260,887260,there are lots of areas of the Earth,PcDftBVDSlc
887260,890260,where human development is much greater,PcDftBVDSlc
890260,892260,"and other areas where it's much less,",PcDftBVDSlc
892260,894260,but between them we see large dark areas,PcDftBVDSlc
894260,896260,of relatively unexplored ocean.,PcDftBVDSlc
896260,898260,The other point I'd like to make about this,PcDftBVDSlc
898260,900260,is that this ocean's interconnected.,PcDftBVDSlc
900260,902260,Marine organisms do not care about international boundaries;,PcDftBVDSlc
902260,904260,they move where they will.,PcDftBVDSlc
904260,907260,And so the importance then of global collaboration,PcDftBVDSlc
907260,909260,becomes all the more important.,PcDftBVDSlc
909260,911260,We've lost a lot of paradise.,PcDftBVDSlc
911260,914260,"For example, these tuna that were once so abundant in the North Sea",PcDftBVDSlc
914260,916260,are now effectively gone.,PcDftBVDSlc
916260,919260,"There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean,",PcDftBVDSlc
919260,921260,which collected more garbage than they did animals.,PcDftBVDSlc
921260,924260,"And that's the deep sea, that's the environment that we consider to be",PcDftBVDSlc
924260,926260,among the most pristine left on Earth.,PcDftBVDSlc
926260,928260,And there are a lot of other pressures.,PcDftBVDSlc
928260,931260,"Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with,",PcDftBVDSlc
931260,934260,"as well as ocean warming, and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs.",PcDftBVDSlc
934260,937260,"On the scale of decades, in our lifetimes,",PcDftBVDSlc
937260,939260,we're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs.,PcDftBVDSlc
939260,942260,"And I could spend the rest of my time, which is getting very limited,",PcDftBVDSlc
942260,944260,"going through this litany of concerns about the ocean,",PcDftBVDSlc
944260,946260,but I want to end on a more positive note.,PcDftBVDSlc
946260,948260,And so the grand challenge then,PcDftBVDSlc
948260,950260,"is to try and make sure that we preserve what's left,",PcDftBVDSlc
950260,952260,because there is still spectacular beauty.,PcDftBVDSlc
952260,954260,"And the oceans are so productive,",PcDftBVDSlc
954260,957260,there's so much going on in there that's of relevance to humans,PcDftBVDSlc
957260,960260,"that we really need to, even from a selfish perspective,",PcDftBVDSlc
960260,962260,try to do better than we have in the past.,PcDftBVDSlc
962260,964260,So we need to recognize those hot spots,PcDftBVDSlc
964260,966260,and do our best to protect them.,PcDftBVDSlc
966260,968260,"When we look at pictures like this, they take our breath away,",PcDftBVDSlc
968260,970260,in addition to helping to give us breath,PcDftBVDSlc
970260,972260,by the oxygen that the oceans provide.,PcDftBVDSlc
972260,975260,"Census scientists worked in the rain, they worked in the cold,",PcDftBVDSlc
975260,977260,they worked under water and they worked above water,PcDftBVDSlc
977260,979260,"trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery,",PcDftBVDSlc
979260,981260,"the still vast unknown,",PcDftBVDSlc
981260,984260,the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life.,PcDftBVDSlc
984260,987260,"So whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile,",PcDftBVDSlc
987260,990260,whether you're a stockbroker in New York City,PcDftBVDSlc
990260,992260,"or whether you're a TEDster living in Edinburgh,",PcDftBVDSlc
992260,994260,the oceans matter.,PcDftBVDSlc
994260,996260,And as the oceans go so shall we.,PcDftBVDSlc
996260,998260,Thanks for listening.,PcDftBVDSlc

33558,37089,"the places nobody else could go, and after three weeks,",8fE29CHJMCg
37089,40095,we realized something. Military veterans,8fE29CHJMCg
40095,43108,"are very, very good at disaster response.",8fE29CHJMCg
43108,45583,"And coming home, my cofounder and I,",8fE29CHJMCg
45583,48846,"we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems.",8fE29CHJMCg
48846,51852,The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response.,8fE29CHJMCg
51852,55166,"It's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology,",8fE29CHJMCg
55166,57547,and it's not using the best people.,8fE29CHJMCg
57547,59752,The second problem that we became aware of,8fE29CHJMCg
59752,62230,"was a very inadequate veteran reintegration,",8fE29CHJMCg
62230,64375,and this is a topic that is front page news right now,8fE29CHJMCg
64375,66536,"as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan,",8fE29CHJMCg
66536,69686,and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.,8fE29CHJMCg
69686,71566,"And we sat here and we looked at these two problems,",8fE29CHJMCg
71566,74300,and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems.,8fE29CHJMCg
74300,77762,These are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that?,8fE29CHJMCg
77762,80832,"Well, we can use disaster response as an opportunity",8fE29CHJMCg
80832,83233,for service for the veterans coming home.,8fE29CHJMCg
83233,85733,Recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want,8fE29CHJMCg
85733,87973,to continue their service when they take off their uniform.,8fE29CHJMCg
87973,91643,And we can use veterans to improve disaster response.,8fE29CHJMCg
91643,94706,"Now on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010,",8fE29CHJMCg
94706,97715,"we responded to the tsunami in Chile,",8fE29CHJMCg
97715,101609,"the floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border.",8fE29CHJMCg
101609,104241,"But it was earlier this year, when one of our",8fE29CHJMCg
104241,108346,original members caused us to shift focus in the organization.,8fE29CHJMCg
108346,111091,This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me.,8fE29CHJMCg
111091,113417,We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.,8fE29CHJMCg
113417,117351,Clay was with us in Port-au-Prince. He was also with us in Chile.,8fE29CHJMCg
117351,121237,"Earlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.",8fE29CHJMCg
121237,123967,"This was a tragedy, but it really forced us",8fE29CHJMCg
123967,127245,to refocus what it is that we were doing.,8fE29CHJMCg
127245,130709,"You know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened",8fE29CHJMCg
130709,133317,in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself,8fE29CHJMCg
133317,136466,because of what he lost when he came home.,8fE29CHJMCg
136466,139931,He lost purpose. He lost his community.,8fE29CHJMCg
139931,144366,"And perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth.",8fE29CHJMCg
144366,147540,"And so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled",8fE29CHJMCg
147540,151854,"from this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems --",8fE29CHJMCg
151854,155094,"in the initial iteration of our organization,",8fE29CHJMCg
155094,157967,we were a disaster response organization that was using,8fE29CHJMCg
157967,160206,"veteran service. We had a lot of success,",8fE29CHJMCg
160206,164419,and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm.,8fE29CHJMCg
164419,167828,"But after Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly,",8fE29CHJMCg
167828,170304,"now moving forward, we see ourselves",8fE29CHJMCg
170304,175197,as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response.,8fE29CHJMCg
175197,177807,Because we think that we can give that purpose,8fE29CHJMCg
177807,180988,and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.,8fE29CHJMCg
180988,183219,"And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later",8fE29CHJMCg
183219,186920,"Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that.",8fE29CHJMCg
186920,190329,Now I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy,8fE29CHJMCg
190329,192805,"who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.",8fE29CHJMCg

199768,203372,That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.,8fE29CHJMCg
203372,205461,It's to keep the men around him alive.,8fE29CHJMCg
205461,207647,It's to pacify the village that he works in.,8fE29CHJMCg
207647,211311,"He's got a purpose. But he comes home [to] Kansas City, Missouri,",8fE29CHJMCg

231382,234543,He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back.,8fE29CHJMCg
234543,236726,He's slept in the same sand. They've lived together.,8fE29CHJMCg
236726,239425,They've eaten together. They've bled together.,8fE29CHJMCg
239425,241823,"He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.",8fE29CHJMCg
241823,244883,He gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off.,8fE29CHJMCg
244883,246222,He doesn't have that community anymore.,8fE29CHJMCg
246222,249456,"But you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri,",8fE29CHJMCg

257758,259297,They send him to Iraq.,8fE29CHJMCg
259297,263652,They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade.,8fE29CHJMCg
263652,266070,He takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones,8fE29CHJMCg
266070,268683,in his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City.,8fE29CHJMCg
268683,270956,He doesn't have that same self-worth.,8fE29CHJMCg
270956,273568,"But you send him to Joplin after a tornado,",8fE29CHJMCg
273568,275388,and somebody once again is walking up to him,8fE29CHJMCg
275388,277762,"and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service,",8fE29CHJMCg
277762,280079,now they have self-worth again.,8fE29CHJMCg

178969,182360,"We're starting to reinvent community ourselves,",qErZ2AQDMB4
182360,185827,and we've done it all without a flipping strategy document.,qErZ2AQDMB4
185827,191138,(Applause),qErZ2AQDMB4
191138,193930,And here's the thing as well.,qErZ2AQDMB4
193930,196346,"We've not asked anybody's permission to do this,",qErZ2AQDMB4
196346,198639,we're just doing it. (Laughter),qErZ2AQDMB4
198639,200400,And we are certainly not waiting for that check,qErZ2AQDMB4
200400,203138,"to drop through the letterbox before we start,",qErZ2AQDMB4
203138,205470,"and most importantly of all, we are not daunted",qErZ2AQDMB4
205470,207322,"by the sophisticated arguments that say,",qErZ2AQDMB4
207322,211218,"These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems,""""",qErZ2AQDMB4
211218,214886,"because I have seen the power of small actions,",qErZ2AQDMB4
214886,216957,and it is awesome.,qErZ2AQDMB4
216957,220070,"So, back to the public meeting. (Laughter)",qErZ2AQDMB4
220070,222959,"We put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds,",qErZ2AQDMB4
222959,224667,and then the room exploded.,qErZ2AQDMB4
224667,228555,"I have never, ever experienced anything like that in my life.",qErZ2AQDMB4
228555,231937,"And it's been the same in every single room, in every town",qErZ2AQDMB4
231937,233492,that we've ever told our story.,qErZ2AQDMB4
233492,237836,People are ready and respond to the story of food.,qErZ2AQDMB4
237836,240093,"They want positive actions they can engage in,",qErZ2AQDMB4
240093,242692,"and in their bones, they know it's time",qErZ2AQDMB4
242692,244581,to take personal responsibility,qErZ2AQDMB4
244581,247152,and invest in more kindness to each other,qErZ2AQDMB4
247152,250075,and to the environment.,qErZ2AQDMB4
250075,253389,"And since we had that meeting three and a half years ago,",qErZ2AQDMB4
253389,256639,it's been a heck of a roller coaster.,qErZ2AQDMB4
256639,259535,"We started with a seed swap, really simple stuff,",qErZ2AQDMB4
259535,261784,"and then we took an area of land, a strip on the side",qErZ2AQDMB4
261784,264286,"of our main road, which was a dog toilet, basically,",qErZ2AQDMB4
264286,267640,and we turned it into a really lovely herb garden.,qErZ2AQDMB4
267640,269926,We took the corner of the car park in the station,qErZ2AQDMB4
269926,271661,"that you saw, and we made vegetable beds",qErZ2AQDMB4
271661,275185,for everybody to share and pick from themselves.,qErZ2AQDMB4
275185,276494,We went to the doctors. We've just had,qErZ2AQDMB4
276494,279399,"a 6-million-pound health center built in Todmorden,",qErZ2AQDMB4
279399,282087,"and for some reason that I cannot comprehend,",qErZ2AQDMB4
282087,285880,it has been surrounded by prickly plants. (Laughter),qErZ2AQDMB4
285880,288969,"So we went to the doctors, said, Would you mind us taking them up?""""",qErZ2AQDMB4
288969,291323,"They said, Absolutely fine, provided you get planning permission""",qErZ2AQDMB4
291323,293245,"and you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate,""
100;293245;296035;so we did — (Laughter) — and now there are fruit trees""",qErZ2AQDMB4
296035,299330,and bushes and herbs and vegetables,qErZ2AQDMB4
299330,302560,around that doctor's surgery.,qErZ2AQDMB4
302560,304836,"And there's been lots of other examples, like the corn",qErZ2AQDMB4
304836,306692,"that was in front of the police station,",qErZ2AQDMB4
306692,308509,and the old people's home that we've planted it with food,qErZ2AQDMB4
308509,310481,that they can pick and grow.,qErZ2AQDMB4
310481,312191,"But it isn't just about growing,",qErZ2AQDMB4
312191,314736,because we all are part of this jigsaw.,qErZ2AQDMB4
314736,317610,It's about taking those artistic people in your community,qErZ2AQDMB4
317610,319843,and doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds,qErZ2AQDMB4
319843,321914,"to explain to people what's growing there,",qErZ2AQDMB4
321914,324130,because there's so many people that don't really recognize,qErZ2AQDMB4
324130,326018,a vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic,qErZ2AQDMB4
326018,328090,with a bit of an instruction packet on the top. (Laughter),qErZ2AQDMB4
328090,330986,"So we have some people who designed these things,",qErZ2AQDMB4
330986,333003,"If it looks like this, please don't pick it, but if it looks like this,""",qErZ2AQDMB4
333003,334980,"help yourself.""
118;334980;337849;This is about sharing and investing in kindness.""",qErZ2AQDMB4
337849,339706,And for those people that don't want to do either,qErZ2AQDMB4
339706,341705,"of those things, maybe they can cook,",qErZ2AQDMB4
341705,344578,"so we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street,",qErZ2AQDMB4
344578,346811,"or in the pub, or in the church,",qErZ2AQDMB4
346811,348443,or wherever people are living their lives.,qErZ2AQDMB4
348443,350985,"This is about us going to the people and saying,",qErZ2AQDMB4
350985,353394,"We are all part of the local food jigsaw,""",qErZ2AQDMB4
353394,356049,"we are all part of a solution.""
127;356049;358265;And then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists""",qErZ2AQDMB4
358265,360973,"and we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic,",qErZ2AQDMB4
360973,363549,"we thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience?",qErZ2AQDMB4
363549,365953,"So we invented, without asking, of course,",qErZ2AQDMB4
365953,368059,the Incredible Edible Green Route.,qErZ2AQDMB4
368059,370784,"And this is a route of exhibition gardens,",qErZ2AQDMB4
370784,375495,"and edible towpaths, and bee-friendly sites, and the story",qErZ2AQDMB4
375495,378363,"of pollinators, and it's a route that we designed",qErZ2AQDMB4
378363,380969,"that takes people through the whole of our town,",qErZ2AQDMB4
380969,384188,"past our cafes and our small shops, through our market,",qErZ2AQDMB4
384188,387601,"not just to and fro from the supermarket,",qErZ2AQDMB4
387601,389899,"and we're hoping that, in changing people's footfall",qErZ2AQDMB4
389899,392754,"around our town, we're also changing their behavior.",qErZ2AQDMB4
392754,396474,"And then there's the second plate, the learning plate.",qErZ2AQDMB4
396474,398054,"Well, we're in partnership with a high school.",qErZ2AQDMB4
398054,401127,We've created a company. We are designing and building,qErZ2AQDMB4
401127,403175,an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare,qErZ2AQDMB4
403175,405082,"at the back of the high school, like you do,",qErZ2AQDMB4
405082,407275,and now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables,qErZ2AQDMB4
407275,409824,"in an orchard with bees,",qErZ2AQDMB4
409824,412082,"and the kids are helping us build that,",qErZ2AQDMB4
412082,414895,"and the kids are on the board, and because the community",qErZ2AQDMB4
414895,416427,"was really keen on working with the high school,",qErZ2AQDMB4
416427,419795,"the high school is now teaching agriculture,",qErZ2AQDMB4
419795,422911,"and because it's teaching agriculture, we started to think,",qErZ2AQDMB4
422911,425694,how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification,qErZ2AQDMB4
425694,428245,"before in their lives but are really excited about growing,",qErZ2AQDMB4
428245,429949,how can we give them some more experience?,qErZ2AQDMB4
429949,431908,So we got some land that was donated,qErZ2AQDMB4
431908,433166,by a local garden center.,qErZ2AQDMB4
433166,436500,"It was really quite muddy, but in a truly incredible way,",qErZ2AQDMB4
436500,439110,"totally voluntary-led, we have turned that",qErZ2AQDMB4
439110,441307,"into a market garden training center,",qErZ2AQDMB4
441307,444271,and that is polytunnels and raised beds,qErZ2AQDMB4
444271,446975,and all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers,qErZ2AQDMB4
446975,449296,and think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future.,qErZ2AQDMB4
449296,451504,"And because we were doing that, some local academics said,",qErZ2AQDMB4
451504,452836,"You know, we could help design""",qErZ2AQDMB4
452836,454608,a commercial horticulture course for you.,qErZ2AQDMB4
454608,456003,"There's not one that we know of.""
167;456003;458647;So they're doing that, and we're going to launch it later this year,""",qErZ2AQDMB4
458647,461232,"and it's all an experiment, and it's all voluntary.",qErZ2AQDMB4
461232,462851,"And then there's the third plate,",qErZ2AQDMB4
462851,464669,"because if you walk through an edible landscape,",qErZ2AQDMB4
464669,467264,"and if you're learning new skills, and if you start to get",qErZ2AQDMB4
467264,469312,"interested in what's growing seasonally,",qErZ2AQDMB4
469312,471224,you might just want to spend more of your own money,qErZ2AQDMB4
471224,473304,"in support of local producers,",qErZ2AQDMB4
473304,475056,"not just veg, but meat and cheese and beer",qErZ2AQDMB4
475056,477135,and whatever else it might be.,qErZ2AQDMB4
477135,479872,"But then, we're just a community group, you know.",qErZ2AQDMB4
479872,481830,We're just all volunteers. What could we actually do?,qErZ2AQDMB4
481830,483580,So we did some really simple things.,qErZ2AQDMB4
483580,485367,"We fundraised, we got some blackboards,",qErZ2AQDMB4
485367,486537,"we put Incredible Edible"" on the top,""",qErZ2AQDMB4
486537,488713,"we gave it every market trader that was selling locally,",qErZ2AQDMB4
488713,491640,and they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week.,qErZ2AQDMB4
491640,494096,Really popular. People congregated around it.,qErZ2AQDMB4
494096,495744,Sales were up.,qErZ2AQDMB4
495744,498740,"And then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said,",qErZ2AQDMB4
498740,499717,"We're really serious about this,""""",qErZ2AQDMB4
499717,502135,"but they didn't actually believe us, so we thought,",qErZ2AQDMB4
502135,504760,"okay, what should we do? I know. If we can create",qErZ2AQDMB4
504760,507334,a campaign around one product and show them,qErZ2AQDMB4
507334,509377,"there is local loyalty to that product,",qErZ2AQDMB4
509377,511720,maybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious.,qErZ2AQDMB4
511720,514711,So we launched a campaign -- because it just amuses me --,qErZ2AQDMB4
514711,516784,called Every Egg Matters. (Laughter),qErZ2AQDMB4
516784,520405,And what we did was we put people on our egg map.,qErZ2AQDMB4
520405,522556,It's a stylized map of Togmorden.,qErZ2AQDMB4
522556,524195,Anybody that's selling their excess eggs,qErZ2AQDMB4
524195,526733,"at the garden gate, perfectly legally, to their neighbors,",qErZ2AQDMB4
526733,529150,"we've stuck on there. We started with four,",qErZ2AQDMB4
529150,531424,"and we've now got 64 on, and the result of that was",qErZ2AQDMB4
531424,532924,that people were then going into shops,qErZ2AQDMB4
532924,535605,"asking for a local Todmorden egg, and the result of that",qErZ2AQDMB4
535605,537894,"was, some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got",qErZ2AQDMB4
537894,540003,"of free range birds, and then they went on to meat birds,",qErZ2AQDMB4
540003,542584,"and although these are really, really small steps,",qErZ2AQDMB4
542584,547273,that increasing local economic confidence,qErZ2AQDMB4
547273,549850,"is starting to play out in a number of ways,",qErZ2AQDMB4
549850,551152,and we now have farmers doing cheese,qErZ2AQDMB4
551152,552941,"and they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs,",qErZ2AQDMB4
552941,554349,they're doing pasties and pies and things,qErZ2AQDMB4
554349,556722,that they would have never done before.,qErZ2AQDMB4
556722,559343,"We've got increasing market stalls selling local food,",qErZ2AQDMB4
559343,563557,"and in a survey that local students did for us, 49 percent",qErZ2AQDMB4
563557,566510,of all food traders in that town said that their bottom line,qErZ2AQDMB4
566510,568916,had increased because of what we were actually doing.,qErZ2AQDMB4
568916,572006,And we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment.,qErZ2AQDMB4
572006,573410,(Laughter),qErZ2AQDMB4
573410,575820,"Now, none of this is rocket science.",qErZ2AQDMB4
575820,578699,"It certainly is not clever, and it's not original.",qErZ2AQDMB4
578699,582506,"But it is joined up, and it is inclusive.",qErZ2AQDMB4

608086,608634,"but going back to that first question that we asked,",qErZ2AQDMB4
610559,613818,is it replicable? Yeah. It most certainly is replicable.,qErZ2AQDMB4

667921,669406,have decided to do two things.,qErZ2AQDMB4

672515,674746,"that they've got, put it in a food bank so that communities",qErZ2AQDMB4
674746,676482,"can use that wherever they live,",qErZ2AQDMB4
676482,678659,and they're going to underpin that with a license.,qErZ2AQDMB4
678659,681040,"And then they've said to every single one of their workforce,",qErZ2AQDMB4
681040,683537,"if you can, help those communities grow,",qErZ2AQDMB4

687689,689969,from local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed.,qErZ2AQDMB4
689969,694394,We are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded,qErZ2AQDMB4
694394,696573,"of us, and there's lots more you could do.",qErZ2AQDMB4
696573,698933,"I mean, just to list a few. One, please stop putting",qErZ2AQDMB4
698933,702301,prickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space.,qErZ2AQDMB4
702301,705703,"(Laughter) Secondly, please create -- please, please create",qErZ2AQDMB4

98160,102160,"high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and",ZBWwREYWzbU
102160,105160,the interiors were completely out of sync with that.,ZBWwREYWzbU
105160,108160,In fact it appeared like they,ZBWwREYWzbU
108160,111160,referenced a mountain cabin.,ZBWwREYWzbU
111160,113160,"That seemed really like a crisis to me,",ZBWwREYWzbU
113160,115160,that they had never been able to,ZBWwREYWzbU
115160,117160,develop a vocabulary,ZBWwREYWzbU
117160,121160,"about escape, and about travel, and modernity",ZBWwREYWzbU
121160,123160,in this trailer that was consistent with the shell.,ZBWwREYWzbU
123160,127160,We really needed to do some archeology,ZBWwREYWzbU
127160,129160,in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic,ZBWwREYWzbU
129160,131160,"in an Airstream trailer,",ZBWwREYWzbU
131160,134160,and what feels like it has true purpose and utility.,ZBWwREYWzbU
134160,136160,We stripped out all the vinyl,ZBWwREYWzbU
136160,138160,and zolatone paint that was covering up,ZBWwREYWzbU
138160,141160,this just fantastic aluminum shell.,ZBWwREYWzbU
141160,144160,We took off all the visible hardware and trim,ZBWwREYWzbU
144160,147160,that was kind of doing the country cabin thing.,ZBWwREYWzbU
147160,151160,"I literally drew on the walls of the trailer,",ZBWwREYWzbU
151160,153160,"mocked it up in cardboard,",ZBWwREYWzbU
153160,156160,"we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong,",ZBWwREYWzbU
156160,158160,"pull it out, put it back in.",ZBWwREYWzbU
158160,162160,"The main goal was to smooth out the interior,",ZBWwREYWzbU
162160,165160,"and begin to speak about motion,",ZBWwREYWzbU
165160,168160,"and mobility, and independence.",ZBWwREYWzbU
168160,171160,The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers,ZBWwREYWzbU
171160,174160,is that when you're designing there's actually no,ZBWwREYWzbU
174160,178160,logical place to stop and start materials,ZBWwREYWzbU
178160,180160,because of the continuous form of the trailer.,ZBWwREYWzbU
180160,183160,There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling,ZBWwREYWzbU
183160,186160,"coming together, where you can change materials and shapes.",ZBWwREYWzbU
186160,188160,So that became a challenge.,ZBWwREYWzbU
188160,190160,"Compounding that,",ZBWwREYWzbU
190160,192160,"the material of choice, laminate,",ZBWwREYWzbU
192160,194160,"that I was trying to highlight,",ZBWwREYWzbU
194160,196160,only bends in two dimensions.,ZBWwREYWzbU
196160,198160,It's a compound curve interior.,ZBWwREYWzbU
198160,200160,What I had to devise was,ZBWwREYWzbU
200160,204160,a way of fooling the eye,ZBWwREYWzbU
204160,207160,into believing that all these panels,ZBWwREYWzbU
207160,209160,are curved with the shell.,ZBWwREYWzbU
209160,211160,What I came up with was,ZBWwREYWzbU
211160,213160,a series of second skins,ZBWwREYWzbU
213160,218160,that basically float over the aluminum shell.,ZBWwREYWzbU
218160,220160,And what I was trying to do there was,ZBWwREYWzbU
220160,222160,"direct your eye in the space,",ZBWwREYWzbU
222160,225160,"so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way,",ZBWwREYWzbU
225160,230160,and that the casework wouldn't break up the space.,ZBWwREYWzbU
230160,232160,They also gave us a way to run power,ZBWwREYWzbU
232160,234160,"and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin,",ZBWwREYWzbU
234160,237160,so they function as an electrical chase.,ZBWwREYWzbU
237160,239160,"That's the trailer, pretty much finished.",ZBWwREYWzbU
239160,242160,"That trailer led to another commission,",ZBWwREYWzbU
242160,246160,to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.,ZBWwREYWzbU
246160,250160,"Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.",ZBWwREYWzbU
250160,253160,"Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee,",ZBWwREYWzbU
253160,257160,he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.,ZBWwREYWzbU
257160,260160,He said one he would like to,ZBWwREYWzbU
260160,264160,"make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.",ZBWwREYWzbU
264160,267160,"Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.",ZBWwREYWzbU
267160,269160,We came up with a fantasy scenario,ZBWwREYWzbU
269160,271160,"of a DJ traveling around the States,",ZBWwREYWzbU
271160,274160,that would collect records and go on tours.,ZBWwREYWzbU
274160,277160,"This trailer housed two turntables,",ZBWwREYWzbU
277160,281160,"mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.",ZBWwREYWzbU
281160,284160,"It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people,",ZBWwREYWzbU
284160,287160,and basically we'd had a great time with this.,ZBWwREYWzbU
287160,290160,"And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel,",ZBWwREYWzbU
290160,294160,"and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.",ZBWwREYWzbU
294160,296160,A lot of these ideas migrated into,ZBWwREYWzbU
296160,299160,the production trailers for Airstream.,ZBWwREYWzbU
299160,303160,This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.,ZBWwREYWzbU
303160,305160,"They came to me and said,",ZBWwREYWzbU
305160,307160,"Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?""",ZBWwREYWzbU
307160,311160,"And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers,",ZBWwREYWzbU
311160,313160,"rock climbers, would use these things?""
107;313160;316160;And I said, ""Well, not in that interior.""""",ZBWwREYWzbU
316160,317160,(Laughter),ZBWwREYWzbU

319160,322160,"about six times during the process of building this prototype,",ZBWwREYWzbU
322160,324160,and it's called the Bambi prototype.,ZBWwREYWzbU

337160,339160,"same tools, same things.",ZBWwREYWzbU
339160,343160,So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me --,ZBWwREYWzbU
343160,348160,"that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology,",ZBWwREYWzbU
348160,350160,and there's no money for tooling or molding.,ZBWwREYWzbU
350160,353160,The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.,ZBWwREYWzbU
353160,356160,"All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely,",ZBWwREYWzbU
356160,360160,"so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers,",ZBWwREYWzbU
360160,363160,"you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.",ZBWwREYWzbU

38160,41160,how we would make a single diagnostic assay,2od4mp91q9w
41160,44160,to screen for all pathogens simultaneously --,2od4mp91q9w
44160,46160,"well, there's some problems with this idea.",2od4mp91q9w
46160,50160,"First of all, viruses are pretty complex,",2od4mp91q9w
50160,54160,but they're also evolving very fast.,2od4mp91q9w
54160,55160,This is a picornavirus.,2od4mp91q9w

60160,62160,"You're looking at the outside shell of the virus,",2od4mp91q9w

72160,76160,"usually it's the fast-evolving problem that's an issue,",2od4mp91q9w
76160,78160,because how can we detect things if they're always changing?,2od4mp91q9w
78160,80160,But evolution is a balance:,2od4mp91q9w
80160,84160,"where you have fast change, you also have ultra-conservation --",2od4mp91q9w
84160,86160,things that almost never change.,2od4mp91q9w
86160,89160,"And so we looked into this a little more carefully,",2od4mp91q9w
89160,90160,and I'm going to show you data now.,2od4mp91q9w
90160,93160,This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop.,2od4mp91q9w
93160,95160,"I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses,",2od4mp91q9w
95160,97160,"like the common cold, like polio and so on,",2od4mp91q9w
97160,101160,and I just broke them down into small segments.,2od4mp91q9w
101160,104160,"And so took this first example, which is called coxsackievirus,",2od4mp91q9w
104160,106160,and just break it into small windows.,2od4mp91q9w
106160,108160,And I'm coloring these small windows blue,2od4mp91q9w
108160,113160,if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome,2od4mp91q9w
113160,114160,to that virus.,2od4mp91q9w
114160,116160,These sequences right up here --,2od4mp91q9w
116160,118160,"which don't even code for protein, by the way --",2od4mp91q9w
118160,121160,"are almost absolutely identical across all of these,",2od4mp91q9w
121160,125160,so I could use this sequence as a marker,2od4mp91q9w
125160,127160,"to detect a wide spectrum of viruses,",2od4mp91q9w
127160,130160,without having to make something individual.,2od4mp91q9w
130160,132160,"Now, over here there's great diversity:",2od4mp91q9w
132160,134160,that's where things are evolving fast.,2od4mp91q9w
134160,138160,Down here you can see slower evolution: less diversity.,2od4mp91q9w
138160,140160,"Now, by the time we get out here to, let's say,",2od4mp91q9w
140160,142160,acute bee paralysis virus --,2od4mp91q9w
142160,144160,probably a bad one to have if you're a bee ---,2od4mp91q9w
144160,149160,"this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus,",2od4mp91q9w
149160,153160,but I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved,2od4mp91q9w
153160,155160,among these viruses on the right-hand of the screen,2od4mp91q9w
155160,158160,are in identical regions right up here.,2od4mp91q9w
158160,161160,And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation,2od4mp91q9w
161160,164160,through evolution -- how these viruses evolved --,2od4mp91q9w
164160,167160,by just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements,2od4mp91q9w
167160,171160,in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents.,2od4mp91q9w
171160,174160,"OK, so that's what we did, but how are we going to do that?",2od4mp91q9w
174160,176160,"Well, for a long time, since I was in graduate school,",2od4mp91q9w
176160,179160,I've been messing around making DNA chips --,2od4mp91q9w
179160,181160,"that is, printing DNA on glass.",2od4mp91q9w
181160,182160,And that's what you see here:,2od4mp91q9w
182160,185160,"These little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass,",2od4mp91q9w
185160,188160,and so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip,2od4mp91q9w
188160,190160,and use them as a detection reagent.,2od4mp91q9w
190160,192160,We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard,2od4mp91q9w
192160,194160,"and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots,",2od4mp91q9w
194160,196160,and this is what you see:,2od4mp91q9w
196160,199160,you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.,2od4mp91q9w
199160,202160,"So, what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass --",2od4mp91q9w
202160,206160,little flat things -- and these are going to be markers for pathogens.,2od4mp91q9w
206160,209160,"OK, I make little robots in lab to make these chips,",2od4mp91q9w
209160,212160,and I'm really big on disseminating technology.,2od4mp91q9w
212160,215160,"If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry,",2od4mp91q9w
215160,217160,"you can build one of these too,",2od4mp91q9w
217160,221160,"and so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web, totally free,",2od4mp91q9w
221160,223160,with basically order-off-the-shelf parts.,2od4mp91q9w
223160,226160,You can build a DNA array machine in your garage.,2od4mp91q9w
226160,229160,Here's the section on the all-important emergency stop switch.,2od4mp91q9w

231160,234160,Every important machine's got to have a big red button.,2od4mp91q9w
234160,236160,"But really, it's pretty robust.",2od4mp91q9w
236160,239160,You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage,2od4mp91q9w
239160,243160,and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun.,2od4mp91q9w
243160,244160,(Laughter),2od4mp91q9w
244160,248160,And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project --,2od4mp91q9w
248160,250160,we just started by making a respiratory virus chip.,2od4mp91q9w
250160,252160,I talked about that --,2od4mp91q9w
252160,254160,"you know, that situation where you go into the clinic",2od4mp91q9w
254160,256160,and you don't get diagnosed?,2od4mp91q9w
256160,258160,"Well, we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses",2od4mp91q9w
258160,261160,"on one chip, and we threw in herpes virus for good measure --",2od4mp91q9w
261160,262160,"I mean, why not?",2od4mp91q9w
262160,264160,"The first thing you do as a scientist is,",2od4mp91q9w
264160,265160,you make sure stuff works.,2od4mp91q9w
265160,268160,"And so what we did is, we take tissue culture cells",2od4mp91q9w
268160,270160,"and infect them with various viruses,",2od4mp91q9w
270160,274160,"and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid,",2od4mp91q9w
274160,277160,the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells --,2od4mp91q9w
277160,281160,mostly viral stuff -- and stick it on the array to see where it sticks.,2od4mp91q9w
281160,283160,"Now, if the DNA sequences match, they'll stick together,",2od4mp91q9w
283160,285160,and so we can look at spots.,2od4mp91q9w
285160,287160,"And if spots light up, we know there's a certain virus in there.",2od4mp91q9w
287160,289160,"That's what one of these chips really looks like,",2od4mp91q9w
289160,292160,"and these red spots are, in fact, signals coming from the virus.",2od4mp91q9w
292160,295160,And each spot represents a different family of virus,2od4mp91q9w
295160,296160,or species of virus.,2od4mp91q9w
296160,298160,"And so, that's a hard way to look at things,",2od4mp91q9w
298160,300160,"so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode,",2od4mp91q9w
300160,304160,"grouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way.",2od4mp91q9w
304160,306160,"What we did is, we took tissue culture cells",2od4mp91q9w
306160,308160,"and infected them with adenovirus,",2od4mp91q9w
308160,312160,and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus.,2od4mp91q9w
312160,315160,"And, likewise, we infected them with parainfluenza-3 --",2od4mp91q9w
315160,317160,that's a paramyxovirus -- and you see a little barcode here.,2od4mp91q9w
317160,320160,And then we did respiratory syncytial virus.,2od4mp91q9w
320160,322160,That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere --,2od4mp91q9w
322160,324160,"it's like boogeremia, basically.",2od4mp91q9w
324160,325160,(Laughter),2od4mp91q9w
325160,329160,"You can see that this barcode is the same family,",2od4mp91q9w
329160,331160,"but it's distinct from parainfluenza-3,",2od4mp91q9w
331160,333160,which gives you a very bad cold.,2od4mp91q9w
333160,336160,"And so we're getting unique signatures, a fingerprint for each virus.",2od4mp91q9w
336160,339160,"Polio and rhino: they're in the same family, very close to each other.",2od4mp91q9w
339160,341160,"Rhino's the common cold, and you all know what polio is,",2od4mp91q9w
341160,344160,and you can see that these signatures are distinct.,2od4mp91q9w
344160,347160,And Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus,2od4mp91q9w
347160,349160,gives a nice signature down here.,2od4mp91q9w
349160,351160,And so it is not any one stripe or something,2od4mp91q9w
351160,353160,that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here;,2od4mp91q9w
353160,357160,it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing.,2od4mp91q9w
357160,359160,"All right, I can see a rhinovirus --",2od4mp91q9w
359160,361160,and here's the blow-up of the rhinovirus's little barcode --,2od4mp91q9w
361160,363160,but what about different rhinoviruses?,2od4mp91q9w
363160,365160,How do I know which rhinovirus I have?,2od4mp91q9w
365160,368160,"There're 102 known variants of the common cold,",2od4mp91q9w
368160,371160,and there're only 102 because people got bored collecting them:,2od4mp91q9w
371160,373160,there are just new ones every year.,2od4mp91q9w
373160,375160,"And so, here are four different rhinoviruses,",2od4mp91q9w
375160,377160,"and you can see, even with your eye,",2od4mp91q9w
377160,379160,without any fancy computer pattern-matching,2od4mp91q9w
379160,381160,"recognition software algorithms,",2od4mp91q9w
381160,384160,that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other.,2od4mp91q9w
384160,386160,"Now, this is kind of a cheap shot,",2od4mp91q9w
386160,389160,"because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is,",2od4mp91q9w
389160,390160,and I in fact designed the chip,2od4mp91q9w
390160,392160,"expressly to be able to tell them apart,",2od4mp91q9w
392160,396160,but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer?,2od4mp91q9w
396160,398160,We don't know what the sequence is; just pull them out of the field.,2od4mp91q9w
398160,400160,"So, here are four rhinoviruses",2od4mp91q9w
400160,402160,we never knew anything about --,2od4mp91q9w
402160,405160,no one's ever sequenced them -- and you can also see,2od4mp91q9w
405160,407160,that you get unique and distinguishable patterns.,2od4mp91q9w
407160,410160,"You can imagine building up some library, whether real or virtual,",2od4mp91q9w
410160,412160,of fingerprints of essentially every virus.,2od4mp91q9w
412160,415160,"But that's, again, shooting fish in a barrel, you know, right?",2od4mp91q9w
415160,417160,You have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses.,2od4mp91q9w
417160,419160,What about real people?,2od4mp91q9w
419160,421160,"You can't control real people, as you probably know.",2od4mp91q9w
421160,425160,"You have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup,",2od4mp91q9w
425160,428160,"and it's probably really complex, right?",2od4mp91q9w
428160,431160,"It could have lots of bacteria, it could have more than one virus,",2od4mp91q9w
431160,433160,and it certainly has host genetic material.,2od4mp91q9w
433160,434160,So how do we deal with this?,2od4mp91q9w
434160,436160,And how do we do the positive control here?,2od4mp91q9w
436160,438160,"Well, it's pretty simple.",2od4mp91q9w
438160,440160,"That's me, getting a nasal lavage.",2od4mp91q9w
440160,445160,"And the idea is, let's experimentally inoculate people with virus.",2od4mp91q9w
445160,450160,"This is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid.",2od4mp91q9w
450160,453160,And basically we experimentally inoculate people,2od4mp91q9w
453160,454160,with the common cold virus.,2od4mp91q9w
454160,456160,"Or, even better, let's just take people",2od4mp91q9w
456160,457160,right out of the emergency room --,2od4mp91q9w
457160,461160,"undefined, community-acquired respiratory tract infections.",2od4mp91q9w
461160,463160,You have no idea what walks in through the door.,2od4mp91q9w
463160,466160,"So, let's start off with the positive control first,",2od4mp91q9w
466160,468160,where we know the person was healthy.,2od4mp91q9w
468160,470160,"They got a shot of virus up the nose,",2od4mp91q9w
470160,471160,let's see what happens.,2od4mp91q9w
471160,473160,Day zero: nothing happening.,2od4mp91q9w
473160,475160,They're healthy; they're clean -- it's amazing.,2od4mp91q9w
475160,477160,"Actually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses",2od4mp91q9w
477160,478160,even when you're walking around healthy.,2od4mp91q9w
478160,480160,"It's pretty clean. If you're healthy, you're pretty healthy.",2od4mp91q9w
480160,484160,"Day two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern,",2od4mp91q9w
484160,486160,and it's very similar to what we get in the lab,2od4mp91q9w
486160,487160,doing our tissue culture experiment.,2od4mp91q9w
487160,490160,"So that's great, but again, cheap shot, right?",2od4mp91q9w
490160,492160,We put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So --,2od4mp91q9w
492160,493160,(Laughter),2od4mp91q9w
493160,497160,"-- I mean, we wanted it to work. He really had a cold.",2od4mp91q9w
497160,501160,"So, how about the people who walk in off the street?",2od4mp91q9w
501160,503160,Here are two individuals represented by their anonymous ID codes.,2od4mp91q9w
503160,507160,They both have rhinoviruses; we've never seen this pattern in lab.,2od4mp91q9w
507160,509160,We sequenced part of their viruses;,2od4mp91q9w
509160,512160,they're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen.,2od4mp91q9w
512160,514160,"Remember, our evolutionary-conserved sequences",2od4mp91q9w
514160,516160,we're using on this array allow us to detect,2od4mp91q9w
516160,518160,"even novel or uncharacterized viruses,",2od4mp91q9w
518160,522160,because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution.,2od4mp91q9w
522160,525160,Here's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here.,2od4mp91q9w
525160,527160,These different blocks represent,2od4mp91q9w
527160,529160,"the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family,",2od4mp91q9w
529160,530160,so you can kind of go down the blocks,2od4mp91q9w
530160,532160,and see where the signal is.,2od4mp91q9w
532160,535160,"Well, doesn't have canine distemper; that's probably good.",2od4mp91q9w
535160,537160,(Laughter),2od4mp91q9w
537160,539160,"But by the time you get to block nine,",2od4mp91q9w
539160,541160,you see that respiratory syncytial virus.,2od4mp91q9w
541160,544160,"Maybe they have kids. And then you can see, also,",2od4mp91q9w
544160,546160,the family member that's related: RSVB is showing up here.,2od4mp91q9w
546160,547160,"So, that's great.",2od4mp91q9w
547160,550160,"Here's another individual, sampled on two separate days --",2od4mp91q9w
550160,552160,repeat visits to the clinic.,2od4mp91q9w
552160,555160,"This individual has parainfluenza-1,",2od4mp91q9w
555160,557160,and you can see that there's a little stripe over here,2od4mp91q9w
557160,560160,for Sendai virus: that's mouse parainfluenza.,2od4mp91q9w
560160,564160,The genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun.,2od4mp91q9w
564160,565160,"So, we built out the chip.",2od4mp91q9w
565160,569160,We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it.,2od4mp91q9w
569160,572160,"Why not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus.",2od4mp91q9w
572160,574160,Everything that we could get out of GenBank --,2od4mp91q9w
574160,576160,"that is, the national repository of sequences.",2od4mp91q9w
576160,579160,Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for?,2od4mp91q9w
579160,581160,"Well, first of all, when you have a big chip like this,",2od4mp91q9w
581160,583160,"you need a little bit more informatics,",2od4mp91q9w
583160,585160,so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis.,2od4mp91q9w
585160,588160,"And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns,",2od4mp91q9w
588160,590160,because we're never going to get samples of every virus --,2od4mp91q9w
590160,593160,"it would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns,",2od4mp91q9w
593160,595160,and compare them to our observed result --,2od4mp91q9w
595160,599160,which is a very complex mixture -- and come up with some sort of score,2od4mp91q9w
599160,602160,of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.,2od4mp91q9w
602160,604160,And this is what this looks like.,2od4mp91q9w
604160,606160,"If, for example, you used a cell culture",2od4mp91q9w
606160,608160,"that's chronically infected with papilloma,",2od4mp91q9w
608160,610160,"you get a little computer readout here,",2od4mp91q9w
610160,614160,and our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type 18.,2od4mp91q9w
614160,616160,"And that is, in fact, what these particular cell cultures",2od4mp91q9w
616160,618160,are chronically infected with.,2od4mp91q9w
618160,620160,So let's do something a little bit harder.,2od4mp91q9w
620160,621160,We put the beeper in the clinic.,2od4mp91q9w
621160,624160,"When somebody shows up, and the hospital doesn't know what to do",2od4mp91q9w
624160,626160,"because they can't diagnose it, they call us.",2od4mp91q9w
626160,628160,"That's the idea, and we're setting this up in the Bay Area.",2od4mp91q9w
628160,630160,"And so, this case report happened three weeks ago.",2od4mp91q9w
630160,633160,"We have a 28-year-old healthy woman, no travel history,",2od4mp91q9w
633160,636160,"[unclear], doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.",2od4mp91q9w
636160,640160,"10-day history of fevers, night sweats, bloody sputum --",2od4mp91q9w
640160,642160,she's coughing up blood -- muscle pain.,2od4mp91q9w
642160,646160,"She went to the clinic, and they gave her antibiotics",2od4mp91q9w
646160,647160,and then sent her home.,2od4mp91q9w
647160,651160,"She came back after ten days of fever, right? Still has the fever,",2od4mp91q9w
651160,654160,and she's hypoxic -- she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs.,2od4mp91q9w
654160,655160,They did a CT scan.,2od4mp91q9w
655160,659160,A normal lung is all sort of dark and black here.,2od4mp91q9w
659160,661160,All this white stuff -- it's not good.,2od4mp91q9w
661160,664160,This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation;,2od4mp91q9w
664160,666160,there's likely to be infection.,2od4mp91q9w
666160,669160,"OK. So, the patient was treated then",2od4mp91q9w
669160,673160,"with a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline,",2od4mp91q9w
673160,677160,"and on day three, it didn't help: she had progressed to acute failure.",2od4mp91q9w
677160,680160,"They had to intubate her, so they put a tube down her throat",2od4mp91q9w
680160,681160,and they began to mechanically ventilate her.,2od4mp91q9w
681160,683160,She could no longer breathe for herself.,2od4mp91q9w
683160,685160,What to do next? Don't know.,2od4mp91q9w
685160,688160,"Switch antibiotics: so they switched to another antibiotic,",2od4mp91q9w
688160,690160,Tamiflu.,2od4mp91q9w
690160,692160,"It's not clear why they thought she had the flu,",2od4mp91q9w
692160,694160,but they switched to Tamiflu.,2od4mp91q9w
694160,696160,"And on day six, they basically threw in the towel.",2od4mp91q9w
696160,700160,You do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options.,2od4mp91q9w
700160,702160,"There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure,",2od4mp91q9w
702160,705160,and so basically -- and what do they learn from it?,2od4mp91q9w
705160,707160,You're looking at her open lung biopsy.,2od4mp91q9w
707160,709160,"And I'm no pathologist, but you can't tell much from this.",2od4mp91q9w
709160,712160,"All you can tell is, there's a lot of swelling: bronchiolitis.",2od4mp91q9w
712160,715160,"It was unrevealing"": that's the pathologist's report.""",2od4mp91q9w
715160,718160,"And so, what did they test her for?",2od4mp91q9w
718160,719160,"They have their own tests, of course,",2od4mp91q9w
719160,722160,"and so they tested her for over 70 different assays,",2od4mp91q9w
722160,725160,for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay,2od4mp91q9w
725160,727160,you can buy off the shelf:,2od4mp91q9w
727160,730160,"SARS, metapneumovirus, HIV, RSV -- all these.",2od4mp91q9w
730160,734160,"Everything came back negative, over 100,000 dollars worth of tests.",2od4mp91q9w
734160,737160,"I mean, they went to the max for this woman.",2od4mp91q9w
737160,740160,"And basically on hospital day eight, that's when they called us.",2od4mp91q9w
740160,742160,They gave us endotracheal aspirate --,2od4mp91q9w
742160,744160,"you know, a little fluid from the throat,",2od4mp91q9w
744160,746160,from this tube that they got down there -- and they gave us this.,2od4mp91q9w
746160,751160,"We put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4.",2od4mp91q9w
751160,753160,"Well, what the hell's parainfluenza-4?",2od4mp91q9w
753160,756160,No one tests for parainfluenza-4. No one cares about it.,2od4mp91q9w
756160,759160,"In fact, it's not even really sequenced that much.",2od4mp91q9w
759160,761160,There's just a little bit of it sequenced.,2od4mp91q9w
761160,763160,There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.,2od4mp91q9w
763160,765160,"No one would even consider it,",2od4mp91q9w
765160,768160,because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure.,2od4mp91q9w
768160,771160,And why is that? Just lore. There's no data --,2od4mp91q9w
771160,775160,no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease.,2od4mp91q9w
775160,778160,"Clearly, we have a case of a healthy person that's going down.",2od4mp91q9w
778160,781160,"OK, that's one case report.",2od4mp91q9w
781160,783160,I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes,2od4mp91q9w

789160,791160,to find something new and open a new door.,2od4mp91q9w
791160,795160,Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics,2od4mp91q9w
795160,798160,about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it:,2od4mp91q9w
798160,800160,third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.,2od4mp91q9w
800160,802160,"Lots of risk factors,",2od4mp91q9w
802160,806160,but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.,2od4mp91q9w
806160,808160,"For maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer,",2od4mp91q9w
808160,810160,there are folks that are predisposed to it.,2od4mp91q9w
810160,814160,And the first gene that was mapped in association studies,2od4mp91q9w
814160,818160,"for this, early-onset prostate cancer, was this gene called RNASEL.",2od4mp91q9w
818160,821160,What is that? It's an antiviral defense enzyme.,2od4mp91q9w
821160,823160,"So, we're sitting around and thinking,",2od4mp91q9w
823160,825160,"Why would men who have the mutation --""",2od4mp91q9w
825160,830160,a defect in an antiviral defense system -- get prostate cancer?,2od4mp91q9w
830160,833160,"It doesn't make sense -- unless, maybe, there's a virus?""
321;833160;839160;So, we put tumors --- and now we have over 100 tumors -- on our array.""",2od4mp91q9w
839160,842160,And we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't.,2od4mp91q9w
842160,845160,"And I'm showing you the signal from the chip here,",2od4mp91q9w
845160,849160,and I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos.,2od4mp91q9w
849160,851160,"And what I'm telling you here from the signal, is",2od4mp91q9w
851160,855160,"that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme,",2od4mp91q9w
855160,859160,"and have a tumor, often have -- 40 percent of the time --",2od4mp91q9w
859160,863160,a signature which reveals a new retrovirus.,2od4mp91q9w
863160,866160,"OK, that's pretty wild. What is it?",2od4mp91q9w
866160,867160,"So, we clone the whole virus.",2od4mp91q9w
867160,871160,"First of all, I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us",2od4mp91q9w
871160,873160,it was very similar to a mouse virus.,2od4mp91q9w
873160,874160,"But that doesn't tell us too much,",2od4mp91q9w
874160,876160,so we actually clone the whole thing.,2od4mp91q9w
876160,878160,And the viral genome I'm showing you right here?,2od4mp91q9w
878160,881160,"It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new;",2od4mp91q9w
881160,882160,no one's ever seen it before.,2od4mp91q9w
882160,885160,"Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice,",2od4mp91q9w
885160,889160,"and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus,",2od4mp91q9w
889160,892160,because it's infecting a species other than mice.,2od4mp91q9w
892160,894160,And this is a little phylogenetic tree,2od4mp91q9w
894160,896160,to see how it's related to other viruses.,2od4mp91q9w
896160,899160,"We've done it for many patients now,",2od4mp91q9w
899160,902160,and we can say that they're all independent infections.,2od4mp91q9w
902160,903160,"They all have the same virus,",2od4mp91q9w
903160,906160,but they're different enough that there's reason to believe,2od4mp91q9w
906160,908160,that they've been independently acquired.,2od4mp91q9w
908160,910160,Is it really in the tissue? And I'll end up with this: yes.,2od4mp91q9w
910160,913160,We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue,2od4mp91q9w
913160,915160,"and use material to actually locate the virus,",2od4mp91q9w
915160,919160,and we find cells here with viral particles in them.,2od4mp91q9w
919160,921160,These guys really do have this virus.,2od4mp91q9w
921160,923160,Does this virus cause prostate cancer?,2od4mp91q9w
923160,927160,Nothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know.,2od4mp91q9w
927160,929160,Is it a link to oncogenesis? I don't know.,2od4mp91q9w
929160,933160,Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses?,2od4mp91q9w
933160,936160,Could be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer.,2od4mp91q9w
936160,937160,But now it's a door.,2od4mp91q9w
937160,940160,We have a strong association between the presence of this virus,2od4mp91q9w
940160,943160,and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer.,2od4mp91q9w
943160,944160,That's where we're at.,2od4mp91q9w
944160,948160,"So, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid,",2od4mp91q9w
948160,950160,"but that's what, you know, science is really good at.",2od4mp91q9w
950160,952160,This was all done by folks in the lab --,2od4mp91q9w
952160,953160,I cannot take credit for most of this.,2od4mp91q9w
953160,954160,This is a collaboration between myself and Don.,2od4mp91q9w

155827,158369,"a local phenomenon, or is truly global?",g_3iLapiTCw
158369,160619,"And, over time, we started understanding",g_3iLapiTCw
160619,162338,and systematically researching,g_3iLapiTCw
162338,164454,"what this tinkering ecosystem is about,",g_3iLapiTCw
164454,166059,because that is something that's happening,g_3iLapiTCw
166059,168091,not just in one street corner in Mumbai.,g_3iLapiTCw
168091,171205,It's actually happening in all parts of the country.,g_3iLapiTCw
171205,173466,"It's even happening in Africa, like, for example,",g_3iLapiTCw
173466,175513,in Cape Town we did extensive research on this.,g_3iLapiTCw
175513,178708,Even here in Doha I found this little nook,g_3iLapiTCw
178708,181595,"where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed,",g_3iLapiTCw
181595,184796,and it's a lot of tiny little parts. It's not easy.,g_3iLapiTCw
184796,186909,You've got to try it on your own to believe it.,g_3iLapiTCw
186909,188463,But what fuels this?,g_3iLapiTCw
188463,191971,It's this entire ecosystem of low-cost parts,g_3iLapiTCw
191971,195277,"and supplies that are produced all over the world, literally,",g_3iLapiTCw
195277,199043,"and then redistributed to basically service this industry,",g_3iLapiTCw
199043,201214,and you can even buy salvaged parts.,g_3iLapiTCw
201214,203370,"Basically, you don't have to necessarily buy",g_3iLapiTCw
203370,205833,brand new things. You have condemned computers,g_3iLapiTCw
205833,207140,"that are stripped apart,",g_3iLapiTCw
207140,208710,and you can buy salvaged components,g_3iLapiTCw
208710,212531,and things that you can reassemble in a new configuration.,g_3iLapiTCw
212531,216012,"But what does this new, sort of, approach give us?",g_3iLapiTCw
216012,217932,"That's the real question, because this is something",g_3iLapiTCw
217932,220157,"that's been there, part of every society",g_3iLapiTCw
220157,222523,that's deprived of enough resources.,g_3iLapiTCw
222523,224420,But there's an interesting paradigm.,g_3iLapiTCw
224420,225912,"There's the traditional crafts,",g_3iLapiTCw
225912,227915,and then there's the technology crafts.,g_3iLapiTCw
227915,230123,We call it the technology crafts because these are emerging.,g_3iLapiTCw
230123,232195,They're not something that's been established.,g_3iLapiTCw
232195,234862,It's not something that's institutionalized.,g_3iLapiTCw
234862,236633,It's not taught in universities.,g_3iLapiTCw
236633,238356,"It's taught [by] word of mouth,",g_3iLapiTCw
238356,240265,and it's an informal education system around this.,g_3iLapiTCw
240265,243067,"So we said, What can we get out of this?""",g_3iLapiTCw
243067,245801,"You know, like, what are the key values that we can get out of this?""
93;245801;248146;The main thing is a fix-it-locally culture,""",g_3iLapiTCw
248146,250486,which is fantastic because it means that your product,g_3iLapiTCw
250486,252531,or your service doesn't have to go through,g_3iLapiTCw
252531,255139,a huge bureaucratic system to get it fixed.,g_3iLapiTCw
255139,258218,"It also affords us cheap fabrication, which is fantastic,",g_3iLapiTCw
258218,260250,so it means that you can do a lot more with it.,g_3iLapiTCw
260250,262564,"And then, the most important thing is,",g_3iLapiTCw
262564,264940,it gives us large math for low cost.,g_3iLapiTCw
264940,267269,So it means that you can actually embed,g_3iLapiTCw
267269,270794,pretty clever algorithms and lots of other kinds,g_3iLapiTCw
270794,274452,of extendable ideas into really simple devices.,g_3iLapiTCw
274452,279260,"So, what we call this is a silicon cottage industry.",g_3iLapiTCw
279260,282206,It's basically what was the system or the paradigm,g_3iLapiTCw
282206,284670,before the industrial revolution is now re-happening,g_3iLapiTCw
284670,287678,in a whole new way in small digital shops,g_3iLapiTCw
287678,290759,across the planet in most developing countries.,g_3iLapiTCw
290759,294893,"So, we kind of toyed around with this idea,",g_3iLapiTCw
294893,296571,"and we said, What can we do with this?""",g_3iLapiTCw
296571,299099,"Can we make a little product or a service out of it?""
112;299099;301519;So one of the first things we did is this thing called""",g_3iLapiTCw
301519,303915,a multimedia platform. We call it a lunch box.,g_3iLapiTCw
303915,306666,Basically one of the contexts that we studied was,g_3iLapiTCw
306666,310153,schools in very remote parts of India.,g_3iLapiTCw
310153,313412,"So there is this amazing concept called the one-teacher school,",g_3iLapiTCw
313412,316114,which is basically a single teacher who is a multitasker,g_3iLapiTCw
316114,318591,who teaches this amazing little social setting.,g_3iLapiTCw
318591,320128,"It's an informal school,",g_3iLapiTCw
320128,322287,but it's really about holistic education.,g_3iLapiTCw
322287,323525,The only thing that they don't have,g_3iLapiTCw
323525,325919,is access to resources. They don't even have a textbook,g_3iLapiTCw
325919,328746,"sometimes, and they don't even have a proper curriculum.",g_3iLapiTCw
328746,332250,"So we said, What can we do to empower this teacher""",g_3iLapiTCw
332250,335062,"to do more? How to access the digital world?""",g_3iLapiTCw
335062,337624,"Instead of being the sole guardian of information,",g_3iLapiTCw
337624,340028,be a facilitator to all this information.,g_3iLapiTCw
340028,343412,"So we said, What are the steps required to empower the teacher?""""",g_3iLapiTCw
343412,346067,"How do you make this teacher into a digital gateway,",g_3iLapiTCw
346067,348599,and how do you design an inexpensive multimedia platform,g_3iLapiTCw
348599,351591,"that can be constructed locally and serviced locally?""
132;351591;353934;So we walked around.""",g_3iLapiTCw
353934,356224,"We went and scavenged the nearby markets,",g_3iLapiTCw
356224,360245,"and we tried to understand, What can we pick up that will make this happen?""""",g_3iLapiTCw
360245,362772,So the thing that we got,g_3iLapiTCw
362772,365979,was a little mobile phone with a little pico projector,g_3iLapiTCw
365979,368316,that comes for about 60 dollars.,g_3iLapiTCw
368316,370772,"We went a bought a flashlight with a very big battery,",g_3iLapiTCw
370772,372562,and a bunch of small speakers.,g_3iLapiTCw
372562,374860,"So essentially, the mobile phone gives us",g_3iLapiTCw
374860,376784,a connected multimedia platform.,g_3iLapiTCw
376784,380269,It allows us to get online and allows us to load up files,g_3iLapiTCw
380269,382620,of different formats and play them.,g_3iLapiTCw
382620,385646,"The flashlight gives us this really intense, bright L.E.D.,",g_3iLapiTCw
385646,388637,"and six hours worth of rechargeable battery pack,",g_3iLapiTCw
388637,390853,and the lunch box is a nice little package,g_3iLapiTCw
390853,392900,"in which you can put everything inside,",g_3iLapiTCw
392900,394463,and a bunch of mini speakers to sort of,g_3iLapiTCw
394463,395881,amplify the sound large enough.,g_3iLapiTCw
395881,399420,"Believe me, those little classrooms are really noisy.",g_3iLapiTCw
399420,402013,"They are kids who scream at the top of their voices,",g_3iLapiTCw
402013,403673,and you really have to get above that.,g_3iLapiTCw
403673,406394,And we took it back to this little tinkering setup,g_3iLapiTCw
406394,408484,"of a mobile phone repair shop,",g_3iLapiTCw
408484,409912,and then the magic happens.,g_3iLapiTCw
409912,411293,"We dismantle the whole thing,",g_3iLapiTCw
411293,413650,"we reassemble it in a new configuration,",g_3iLapiTCw
413650,415828,"and we do this hardware mashup,",g_3iLapiTCw
415828,418437,systematically training the guy how to do this.,g_3iLapiTCw
418437,421892,"Out comes this, a little lunch box -- form factor.",g_3iLapiTCw
421892,428718,(Applause),g_3iLapiTCw
428718,431736,"And we systematically field tested,",g_3iLapiTCw
431736,434104,because in the field testing we learned some,g_3iLapiTCw
434104,436621,"important lessons, and we went through many iterations.",g_3iLapiTCw
436621,439316,One of the key issues was battery consumption and charging.,g_3iLapiTCw
439316,443294,"Luminosity was an issue, when you have too much bright sunlight outside.",g_3iLapiTCw
443294,445846,"Often the roofs are broken, so you don't have enough",g_3iLapiTCw
445846,448974,darkness in the classroom to do these things.,g_3iLapiTCw
448974,451816,"We extended this idea. We tested it many times over,",g_3iLapiTCw
451816,454394,and the next version we came up with was a box,g_3iLapiTCw
454394,456774,"that kind of could trickle charge on solar energy,",g_3iLapiTCw
456774,459573,"but most importantly connect to a car battery,",g_3iLapiTCw
459573,462567,because a car battery is a ubiquitous source of power,g_3iLapiTCw
462567,464774,in places where there's not enough electricity,g_3iLapiTCw
464774,466734,or erratic electricity.,g_3iLapiTCw
466734,468703,And the other key thing that we did was,g_3iLapiTCw
468703,471165,"make this box run off a USB key, because we realized",g_3iLapiTCw
471165,474519,"that even though there was GPRS and all that on paper,",g_3iLapiTCw
474519,477094,"at least, in theory, it was much more efficient",g_3iLapiTCw
477094,480984,to send the data on a little USB key by surface mail.,g_3iLapiTCw
480984,482824,"It might take a few days to get there,",g_3iLapiTCw
482824,485198,but at least it gets there in high definition,g_3iLapiTCw
485198,487413,and in a reliable quality.,g_3iLapiTCw
487413,489695,"So we made this box, and we tested it again",g_3iLapiTCw
489695,491230,"and again and again, and we're going through",g_3iLapiTCw
491230,492779,multiple iterations to do these things.,g_3iLapiTCw
492779,495748,But it's not limited to just education.,g_3iLapiTCw
495748,497614,This kind of a technique or metrology,g_3iLapiTCw
497614,499626,"can actually be applied to other kinds of areas,",g_3iLapiTCw
499626,501534,and I'm going to tell you one more little story.,g_3iLapiTCw
501534,503989,It's about this little device called a medi-meter.,g_3iLapiTCw
503989,507356,It's basically a little health care screening tool that we developed.,g_3iLapiTCw
507356,510683,"In India, there is a context of these amazing people,",g_3iLapiTCw
510683,512962,the health care workers called ASHA workers.,g_3iLapiTCw
512962,515379,They are essentially foot soldiers for the health care system,g_3iLapiTCw
515379,517763,who live in the local community and are trained,g_3iLapiTCw
517763,520331,"with basic tools and basic concepts of health care,",g_3iLapiTCw
520331,524093,and the main purpose is basically to inform people,g_3iLapiTCw
524093,527626,"to basically, how to lead a better life, but also",g_3iLapiTCw
527626,530854,to divert or sort of make recommendations,g_3iLapiTCw
530854,533528,of what kind of health care should they approach?,g_3iLapiTCw
533528,536240,"They are basically referral services, essentially.",g_3iLapiTCw
536240,538548,But the problem with that is that we realized,g_3iLapiTCw
538548,542738,after a bunch of research that they are amazing,g_3iLapiTCw
542738,545218,at referring people to the nearest clinic,g_3iLapiTCw
545218,548091,"or the public health care system, but what happens at the",g_3iLapiTCw
548091,552169,public health care system is this: these incredibly long lines,g_3iLapiTCw
552169,554979,and too many people who overload the system,g_3iLapiTCw
554979,557545,simply because there's not enough doctors and facilities,g_3iLapiTCw
557545,559747,for the population that's being referred.,g_3iLapiTCw
559747,561866,So everything from a common cold,g_3iLapiTCw
561866,564526,to a serious case of malaria gets almost the same,g_3iLapiTCw
564526,567570,"level of attention, and there's no priorities.",g_3iLapiTCw
567570,569641,"So we said, Come on, there's got to be a better way""",g_3iLapiTCw
569641,571442,"of doing this for sure.""
216;571442;574019;So we said, ""What can we do with the ASHA worker""",g_3iLapiTCw
574019,577950,"that'll allow this ASHA worker to become an interesting filter,",g_3iLapiTCw
577950,580465,"but not just a filter, a really well thought through referral",g_3iLapiTCw
580465,583946,"system that allows load balancing of the network,",g_3iLapiTCw
583946,587885,and directs patients to different sources of health care,g_3iLapiTCw
587885,591765,"based on the severity or the criticalness of those situations?""
222;591765;593746;So the real key question was,""",g_3iLapiTCw
593746,595414,how do we empower this woman?,g_3iLapiTCw
595414,597341,How do we empower her with simple tools,g_3iLapiTCw
597341,600292,that's not diagnostic but more screening in nature,g_3iLapiTCw
600292,604072,so she at least knows how to advise the patients better?,g_3iLapiTCw
604072,606100,"And that'll make such a huge difference on the system,",g_3iLapiTCw
606100,611018,because the amount of waiting time and the amount of,g_3iLapiTCw
611018,612938,"distances that people need to travel, often sometimes",g_3iLapiTCw
612938,615611,"seven to 15 kilometers, sometimes by foot,",g_3iLapiTCw
615611,621074,"to get a simple health check done, is very, very detrimental",g_3iLapiTCw
621074,623528,in the sense that it really dissuades people,g_3iLapiTCw
623528,625537,from getting access to health care.,g_3iLapiTCw
625537,627572,"So if there was something that she could do,",g_3iLapiTCw
627572,628681,that would be amazing.,g_3iLapiTCw
628681,631742,So what we did was that we converted this device,g_3iLapiTCw
631742,633559,into a medical device.,g_3iLapiTCw
633559,634835,"I want to demo this actually,",g_3iLapiTCw
634835,637508,because it's a very simple process.,g_3iLapiTCw
637508,639917,"Bruno, do you want to join us? (Cheers)",g_3iLapiTCw
639917,646119,Come along. (Applause),g_3iLapiTCw
646119,649044,"So, what we're going to do is that",g_3iLapiTCw
649044,652016,"we're going to measure a few basic parameters on you,",g_3iLapiTCw
652016,654871,including your pulse rate and the amount of oxygen,g_3iLapiTCw
654871,656744,that's there in your blood.,g_3iLapiTCw
656744,660035,So you're going to put your thumb on top of this.,g_3iLapiTCw
660035,661809,"Bruno Giussani: Like this, works?",g_3iLapiTCw
661809,663475,Vinay Venkatraman: Yeah. That's right. BG: Okay.,g_3iLapiTCw
663475,667483,VV: So I'm going to start it up. I hope it works.,g_3iLapiTCw
667483,671833,"(Beeps) It even beeps, because it's an alarm clock, after all.",g_3iLapiTCw
671833,673845,So ... (Laughter),g_3iLapiTCw
673845,678236,"So I take it into the start position, and then",g_3iLapiTCw
678236,681848,I press the read button. (Beeps),g_3iLapiTCw
681848,687329,So it's taking a little reading from you. (Beeps),g_3iLapiTCw
687329,690107,And then the pointer goes and points to three different options.,g_3iLapiTCw
690107,693382,Let's see what happens here.,g_3iLapiTCw
693382,695465,"(Beeps) Oh Bruno, you can go home, actually.",g_3iLapiTCw
695465,699301,BG: Great. Good news. (Applause),g_3iLapiTCw
699301,701646,VV: So ... (Applause),g_3iLapiTCw
701646,704863,So the thing about this is that,g_3iLapiTCw
704863,708968,"if the pointer, unfortunately, had pointed to the red spot,",g_3iLapiTCw
708968,710814,we would have to rush you to a hospital.,g_3iLapiTCw
710814,714934,"Luckily, not today. And if it had pointed to the orange",g_3iLapiTCw
714934,717763,"or the amber, it basically meant you had to have,",g_3iLapiTCw
717763,720807,"sort of, more continuous care from the health care worker.",g_3iLapiTCw
720807,723158,So that was a very simple three-step screening process,g_3iLapiTCw
723158,725273,that could basically change the equation,g_3iLapiTCw
725273,728013,of how public health care works in so many different ways.,g_3iLapiTCw
728013,729910,BG: Thank you for the good news. VV: Yeah.,g_3iLapiTCw
729910,734303,(Applause),g_3iLapiTCw
734303,737743,"So, very briefly, I'll just explain to you how this is done,",g_3iLapiTCw
737743,740033,because that's the more interesting part.,g_3iLapiTCw
740033,742727,"So essentially, the three things that are required",g_3iLapiTCw
742727,747255,to make this conversion from this guy to this guy,g_3iLapiTCw
747255,751384,is a cheap remote control for a television,g_3iLapiTCw
751384,754295,"that you can almost find in every home today,",g_3iLapiTCw
754295,758009,"some parts from a computer mouse, basically,",g_3iLapiTCw
758009,761872,"something that you can scavenge for very low cost,",g_3iLapiTCw
761872,764783,and a few parts that have to be pre-programmed.,g_3iLapiTCw
764783,767184,Basically this is a micro-controller with a few,g_3iLapiTCw
767184,769979,extra components that can be shipped for very little cost,g_3iLapiTCw
769979,772972,"across the world, and that's what is all required",g_3iLapiTCw
772972,775363,with a little bit of local tinkering talent,g_3iLapiTCw
775363,778150,to convert the device into something else.,g_3iLapiTCw
778150,781546,So we are right now doing some systematic field tests,g_3iLapiTCw
781546,784596,to basically ascertain whether something like this actually,g_3iLapiTCw
784596,786163,makes sense to the ASHA worker.,g_3iLapiTCw
786163,789707,We are going through some reference tests to compare it,g_3iLapiTCw

43330,45330,"that you did it in a typical North American way,",aSNrKS-sCE0
45330,49330,"that is, you were raucous and incoherent.",aSNrKS-sCE0
49330,54330,You were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison.,aSNrKS-sCE0
54330,58330,Do you think you could do it? I would like to see if this audience would --,aSNrKS-sCE0
58330,60330,"no, you haven't practiced, as far as I know --",aSNrKS-sCE0
60330,63330,can you get it together to clap in sync?,aSNrKS-sCE0

76330,78330,(Laughter),aSNrKS-sCE0
78330,82330,"So I didn't expect that, but -- I mean, I expected you could synchronize.",aSNrKS-sCE0
82330,85330,It didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency.,aSNrKS-sCE0

98330,101330,Some trained musicians out there.,aSNrKS-sCE0
101330,103330,Is that what enabled you to synchronize?,aSNrKS-sCE0
103330,106330,"So to put the question a little more seriously,",aSNrKS-sCE0
106330,110330,"let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did,",aSNrKS-sCE0
110330,113330,for spontaneous synchronization.,aSNrKS-sCE0

129330,134330,Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.,aSNrKS-sCE0
134330,141330,"It's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of,",aSNrKS-sCE0
141330,145330,"if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.",aSNrKS-sCE0
145330,151330,It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.,aSNrKS-sCE0
151330,155330,It's a deep tendency toward order in nature,aSNrKS-sCE0
155330,158330,that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy.,aSNrKS-sCE0
158330,161330,"I mean, I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it's not.",aSNrKS-sCE0
161330,163330,But there is a countervailing force in the universe --,aSNrKS-sCE0
163330,168330,the tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme.,aSNrKS-sCE0
168330,172330,"Now, to get into that, let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately",aSNrKS-sCE0
172330,176330,"when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature,",aSNrKS-sCE0
176330,182330,"which is the glorious example of birds that flock together,",aSNrKS-sCE0
182330,186330,or fish swimming in organized schools.,aSNrKS-sCE0
186330,190330,"So these are not particularly intelligent creatures,",aSNrKS-sCE0
190330,193330,"and yet, as we'll see, they exhibit beautiful ballets.",aSNrKS-sCE0
195330,197330,"This is from a BBC show called Predators,""""",aSNrKS-sCE0
197330,202330,and what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.,aSNrKS-sCE0
203330,206330,"When you're small and vulnerable, like these starlings,",aSNrKS-sCE0
206330,213330,"or like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.",aSNrKS-sCE0
215330,218330,Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.,aSNrKS-sCE0
233330,236330,"For a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior,",aSNrKS-sCE0
236330,238330,wondering how it could be possible.,aSNrKS-sCE0
239330,242330,We're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony.,aSNrKS-sCE0
243330,245330,These creatures are not choreographed.,aSNrKS-sCE0
245330,247330,They're choreographing themselves.,aSNrKS-sCE0
249330,252330,And only today is science starting to figure out how it works.,aSNrKS-sCE0
253330,259330,"I'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin, a researcher at Oxford,",aSNrKS-sCE0
259330,261330,that shows how swarms work.,aSNrKS-sCE0
261330,263330,There are just three simple rules.,aSNrKS-sCE0
264330,268330,"First, all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors.",aSNrKS-sCE0
269330,272330,"Second, all the individuals have a tendency to line up.",aSNrKS-sCE0
273330,276330,"And third, they're all attracted to each other,",aSNrKS-sCE0
276330,278330,but they try to keep a small distance apart.,aSNrKS-sCE0
279330,282330,"And when you build those three rules in,",aSNrKS-sCE0
282330,284330,automatically you start to see swarms,aSNrKS-sCE0
284330,287330,that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks.,aSNrKS-sCE0
288330,292330,"Now, fish like to stay close together, about a body length apart.",aSNrKS-sCE0
292330,295330,Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart.,aSNrKS-sCE0
295330,298330,"But except for that difference, the rules are the same for both.",aSNrKS-sCE0
304330,307330,"Now, all this changes when a predator enters the scene.",aSNrKS-sCE0
309330,314330,"There's a fourth rule: when a predator's coming, get out of the way.",aSNrKS-sCE0
323330,326330,Here on the model you see the predator attacking.,aSNrKS-sCE0
328330,330330,"The prey move out in random directions,",aSNrKS-sCE0
330330,333330,"and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again,",aSNrKS-sCE0
333330,336330,so there's this constant splitting and reforming.,aSNrKS-sCE0
337330,339330,And you see that in nature.,aSNrKS-sCE0
347330,353330,"Keep in mind that, although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate,",aSNrKS-sCE0
353330,357330,what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior.,aSNrKS-sCE0
357330,361330,Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers.,aSNrKS-sCE0
363330,366330,"That is, out of the desire to save itself,",aSNrKS-sCE0
366330,369330,"each creature is following these rules,",aSNrKS-sCE0
369330,371330,and that leads to something that's safe for all of them.,aSNrKS-sCE0
371330,374330,"Even though it looks like they're thinking as a group, they're not.",aSNrKS-sCE0
392330,395330,"You might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm,",aSNrKS-sCE0
395330,397330,so you can think of several.,aSNrKS-sCE0

401330,404330,are reduced as compared to a small group.,aSNrKS-sCE0
405330,408330,There are many eyes to spot danger.,aSNrKS-sCE0
408330,415330,"And you'll see in the example with the starlings, with the birds,",aSNrKS-sCE0
415330,417330,"when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them,",aSNrKS-sCE0
417330,420330,"that actually waves of panic can propagate,",aSNrKS-sCE0
420330,423330,sending messages over great distances.,aSNrKS-sCE0

432330,435330,Information can be sent over half a kilometer away,aSNrKS-sCE0
435330,438330,in a very short time through this mechanism.,aSNrKS-sCE0
440330,442330,"Yes, it's happening here.",aSNrKS-sCE0

450330,452330,"from that computer model, what's going on.",aSNrKS-sCE0

462330,466330,I'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better.,aSNrKS-sCE0

482330,485330,"There is one case that we have begun to understand better,",aSNrKS-sCE0
485330,488330,and it's the case of fireflies.,aSNrKS-sCE0

857330,858330,(Laughter),aSNrKS-sCE0
858330,860330,"Now, that might seem a bit whimsical,",aSNrKS-sCE0
860330,865330,but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order,aSNrKS-sCE0
865330,869330,sometimes has unexpected consequences.,aSNrKS-sCE0
869330,871330,"And a clear case of that,",aSNrKS-sCE0
871330,874330,was something that happened in London in the year 2000.,aSNrKS-sCE0
874330,877330,The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London --,aSNrKS-sCE0
877330,881330,"a beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames,",aSNrKS-sCE0
881330,885330,first river crossing in over 100 years in London.,aSNrKS-sCE0
885330,888330,"There was a big competition for the design of this bridge,",aSNrKS-sCE0
888330,892330,and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team --,aSNrKS-sCE0
892330,895330,"in the TED spirit, actually -- of an architect --",aSNrKS-sCE0
895330,899330,"perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom, Lord Norman Foster --",aSNrKS-sCE0
899330,904330,"working with an artist, a sculptor, Sir Anthony Caro,",aSNrKS-sCE0
904330,908330,"and an engineering firm, Ove Arup.",aSNrKS-sCE0
908330,913330,"And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision,",aSNrKS-sCE0
913330,917330,"which was -- he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books,",aSNrKS-sCE0
917330,920330,"and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss,",aSNrKS-sCE0
920330,923330,he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber.,aSNrKS-sCE0
923330,927330,"He would shoot his light saber across the abyss, making a blade of light,",aSNrKS-sCE0
927330,929330,and then scamper across on this blade of light.,aSNrKS-sCE0
929330,931330,"He said, That's the vision I want to give to London.""",aSNrKS-sCE0
931330,934330,"I want a blade of light across the Thames.""
230;935330;937330;So they built the blade of light,""",aSNrKS-sCE0
937330,943330,"and it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's --",aSNrKS-sCE0
943330,946330,"probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is,",aSNrKS-sCE0
946330,949330,with cables that are out on the side.,aSNrKS-sCE0
949330,952330,You're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.,aSNrKS-sCE0
952330,955330,"These cables were on the side of the bridge,",aSNrKS-sCE0
955330,959330,like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames --,aSNrKS-sCE0
959330,961330,that's what's holding up this bridge.,aSNrKS-sCE0
961330,963330,"Now, everyone was very excited to try it out.",aSNrKS-sCE0
963330,968330,"On opening day, thousands of Londoners came out, and something happened.",aSNrKS-sCE0
968330,972330,And within two days the bridge was closed to the public.,aSNrKS-sCE0
972330,977330,So I want to first show you some interviews with people,aSNrKS-sCE0
977330,980330,"who were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened.",aSNrKS-sCE0
980330,985330,"Man: It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down,",aSNrKS-sCE0
985330,988330,rather like being on the boat.,aSNrKS-sCE0
988330,991330,"Woman: Yeah, it felt unstable, and it was very windy,",aSNrKS-sCE0
991330,995330,"and I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides, so you could definitely --",aSNrKS-sCE0
995330,998330,"there was something going on sideways, it felt, maybe.",aSNrKS-sCE0
998330,1000330,Interviewer: Not up and down? Boy: No.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1000330,1002330,Interviewer: And not forwards and backwards? Boy: No.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1002330,1005330,"Interviewer: Just sideways. About how much was it moving, do you think?",aSNrKS-sCE0
1005330,1007330,Boy: It was about --,aSNrKS-sCE0
1007330,1009330,"Interviewer: I mean, that much, or this much?",aSNrKS-sCE0
1009330,1011330,Boy: About the second one.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1011330,1013330,Interviewer: This much? Boy: Yeah.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1013330,1016330,"Man: It was at least six, six to eight inches, I would have thought.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1016330,1018330,"Interviewer: Right, so, at least this much? Man: Oh, yes.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1018330,1020330,Woman: I remember wanting to get off.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1020330,1022330,"Interviewer: Oh, did you? Woman: Yeah. It felt odd.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1022330,1028330,"Interviewer: So it was enough to be scary? Woman: Yeah, but I thought that was just me.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1028330,1031330,"Interviewer: Ah! Now, tell me why you had to do this?",aSNrKS-sCE0
1031330,1033330,"Boy: We had to do this because, to keep in balance",aSNrKS-sCE0
1033330,1035330,"because if you didn't keep your balance,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1035330,1041330,"then you would just fall over about, like, to the left or right, about 45 degrees.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1041330,1045330,Interviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. Right.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1046330,1051330,And then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1051330,1055330,So you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and --,aSNrKS-sCE0
1055330,1057330,"oh, and short steps?",aSNrKS-sCE0
1057330,1060330,Man: That's right. And it seemed obvious to me,aSNrKS-sCE0
1060330,1063330,that it was probably the number of people on it.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1064330,1068330,"Interviewer: Were they deliberately walking in step, or anything like that?",aSNrKS-sCE0
1068330,1072330,"Man: No, they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1072330,1075330,"Steven Strogatz: All right, so that already gives you a hint of what happened.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1075330,1079330,Think of the bridge as being like this platform.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1079330,1082330,Think of the people as being like metronomes.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1082330,1085330,"Now, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1085330,1089330,"but after all, we do walk like -- I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1089330,1092330,"And especially if we start to walk like those people did, right?",aSNrKS-sCE0
1092330,1096330,They all showed this strange sort of skating gait,aSNrKS-sCE0
1096330,1099330,that they adopted once the bridge started to move.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1099330,1102330,And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1102330,1106330,"But also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you'll see an interesting clip",aSNrKS-sCE0
1106330,1111330,"of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1111330,1113330,"who figured out what happened on the bridge,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1113330,1117330,and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1117330,1121330,It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop,aSNrKS-sCE0
1121330,1124330,"between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1124330,1126330,that engineers knew nothing about.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1126330,1128330,"Actually, I think the first person you'll see",aSNrKS-sCE0
1128330,1132330,is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1133330,1135330,(Video) Interviewer: Did anyone get hurt? Engineer: No.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1135330,1138330,Interviewer: Right. So it was quite small -- Engineer: Yes. Interviewer: -- but real?,aSNrKS-sCE0
1138330,1141330,"Engineer: Absolutely. Interviewer: You thought, Oh, bother.""""",aSNrKS-sCE0
1141330,1144330,Engineer: I felt I was disappointed about it.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1144330,1148330,"We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge, and we'd analyzed it,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1148330,1151330,we'd checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes --,aSNrKS-sCE0
1151330,1154330,and here it was doing something that we didn't know about.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1154330,1156330,Interviewer: You didn't expect. Engineer: Exactly.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1156330,1159330,Narrator: The most dramatic and shocking footage,aSNrKS-sCE0
1159330,1162330,shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people --,aSNrKS-sCE0
1162330,1164330,"apparently rocking from side to side in unison,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1164330,1167330,"not only with each other, but with the bridge.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1167330,1171330,This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1171330,1174330,But how could the crowd become synchronized?,aSNrKS-sCE0
1174330,1178330,Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect?,aSNrKS-sCE0
1178330,1182330,This was to be the focus of the investigation.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1182330,1188330,"Interviewer: Well, at last the simulated bridge is finished, and I can make it wobble.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1189330,1193330,"Now, Allan, this is all your fault, isn't it? Allan McRobie: Yes.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1193330,1195330,"Interviewer: You designed this, yes, this simulated bridge,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1195330,1198330,"and this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge?",aSNrKS-sCE0
1198330,1200330,"AM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1200330,1203330,"Interviewer: Right. So if we get on it, we should be able to wobble it, yes?",aSNrKS-sCE0
1206330,1209330,"Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1209330,1212330,suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble,aSNrKS-sCE0
1212330,1214330,in the same way as the real bridge --,aSNrKS-sCE0
1214330,1216330,provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1216330,1219330,"AM: This one's only a couple of tons, so it's fairly easy to get going.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1219330,1222330,"Just by walking. Interviewer: Well, it's certainly going now.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1222330,1225330,AM: It doesn't have to be a real dangle. Just walk. It starts to go.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1225330,1228330,Interviewer: It's actually quite difficult to walk.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1228330,1231330,"You have to be careful where you put your feet down, don't you,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1231330,1234330,"because if you get it wrong, it just throws you off your feet.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1234330,1238330,"AM: It certainly affects the way you walk, yes. You can't walk normally on it.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1239330,1241330,"Interviewer: No. If you try and put one foot in front of another,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1241330,1244330,it's moving your feet away from under you. AM: Yes.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1244330,1246330,Interviewer: So you've got to put your feet out sideways.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1247330,1250330,"So already, the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way",aSNrKS-sCE0
1250330,1252330,as our witnesses walked on the real bridge.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1252330,1255330,AM: ... ice-skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1255330,1257330,"Interviewer: For a more convincing experiment,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1257330,1260330,"I wanted my own opening-day crowd, the sound check team.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1260330,1263330,Their instructions: just walk normally.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1272330,1276330,It's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1276330,1278330,They're all having some difficulty walking.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1279330,1282330,And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1282330,1285330,"But then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.",aSNrKS-sCE0
1287330,1292330,"You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1292330,1294330,and therefore to drive it to move further.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1298330,1302330,"SS: All right, well, with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1302330,1305330,maybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over.,aSNrKS-sCE0
1305330,1308330,"But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way,",aSNrKS-sCE0
1308330,1311330,to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you.,aSNrKS-sCE0

110337,112389,and he wrote prayers on top of these books.,VqtEppZmjfw
112389,114086,And essentially these seven manuscripts,VqtEppZmjfw
114086,118434,"disappeared for 700 years, and we have a prayer book.",VqtEppZmjfw
118434,121683,"The prayer book was discovered by this guy,",VqtEppZmjfw
121683,124410,"Johan Ludvig Heiberg, in 1906.",VqtEppZmjfw
124410,125851,"And with just a magnifying glass,",VqtEppZmjfw
125851,128735,he transcribed as much of the text as he could.,VqtEppZmjfw
128735,131917,And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript,VqtEppZmjfw
131917,133685,that were unique texts.,VqtEppZmjfw
133685,135285,They weren't in A and B at all;,VqtEppZmjfw
135285,136983,"they were completely new texts by Archimedes,",VqtEppZmjfw
136983,140218,"and they were called The Method"" and ""The Stomachion.""""",VqtEppZmjfw
140218,142487,And it became a world famous manuscript.,VqtEppZmjfw
142487,144302,Now it should be clear by now,VqtEppZmjfw
144302,147016,that this book is in bad condition.,VqtEppZmjfw
147016,150486,It got in worse condition in the 20th century,VqtEppZmjfw
150486,152218,after Heiberg saw it.,VqtEppZmjfw
152218,153735,"Forgeries were painted over it,",VqtEppZmjfw
153735,156818,and it suffered very badly from mold.,VqtEppZmjfw
156818,160568,This book is the definition of a write-off.,VqtEppZmjfw
160568,162302,It's the sort of book,VqtEppZmjfw
162302,164967,that you thought would be in an institution.,VqtEppZmjfw
164967,167153,"But it's not in an institution,",VqtEppZmjfw
167153,171785,it was bought by a private owner in 1998.,VqtEppZmjfw
171785,173535,Why did he buy this book?,VqtEppZmjfw
173535,177072,Because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe.,VqtEppZmjfw
177072,180318,He wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous.,VqtEppZmjfw
180318,184984,He wanted to make that which was expensive free.,VqtEppZmjfw
184984,188119,And he wanted to do this as a matter of principle.,VqtEppZmjfw
188119,192651,"Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek,",VqtEppZmjfw
192651,195335,but they should have the chance to do it.,VqtEppZmjfw
195335,198634,"So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes,",VqtEppZmjfw
198634,200770,and he promised to pay for all the work.,VqtEppZmjfw
200770,202468,"And it was an expensive job,",VqtEppZmjfw
202468,205938,but actually it wouldn't be as much as you think,VqtEppZmjfw
205938,208103,"because these people, they didn't come from money,",VqtEppZmjfw
208103,209922,they came from Archimedes.,VqtEppZmjfw
209922,211638,And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds.,VqtEppZmjfw
211638,213821,"They came from particle physics,",VqtEppZmjfw
213821,215387,"they came from classical philology,",VqtEppZmjfw
215387,217355,"they came from book conservation,",VqtEppZmjfw
217355,219937,"they came from ancient mathematics,",VqtEppZmjfw
219937,221854,"they came from data management,",VqtEppZmjfw
221854,224771,they came from scientific imaging and program management.,VqtEppZmjfw
224771,228327,And they got together to work on this manuscript.,VqtEppZmjfw
228327,232138,The first problem was a conservation problem.,VqtEppZmjfw
232138,234571,And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with:,VqtEppZmjfw
234571,236771,There was glue on the spine of the book.,VqtEppZmjfw
236771,238972,"And if you look at this photograph carefully,",VqtEppZmjfw
238972,241020,the bottom half of this is rather brown.,VqtEppZmjfw
241020,242388,And that glue is hide glue.,VqtEppZmjfw
242388,243773,"Now if you're a conservator,",VqtEppZmjfw
243773,245905,you can take off this glue reasonably easily.,VqtEppZmjfw
245905,249270,The top half is Elmer's wood glue.,VqtEppZmjfw
249270,251387,It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion,VqtEppZmjfw
251387,254054,that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry.,VqtEppZmjfw
254054,257220,And it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on.,VqtEppZmjfw
257220,260571,"And so before we could start imaging Archimedes,",VqtEppZmjfw
260571,262020,we had to take this book apart.,VqtEppZmjfw
262020,264871,So it took four years to take apart.,VqtEppZmjfw
264871,268404,"And this is a rare action shot, ladies and gentlemen.",VqtEppZmjfw
268404,271175,(Laughter),VqtEppZmjfw
271175,275441,"Another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax,",VqtEppZmjfw
275441,277676,because this was used in the liturgical services,VqtEppZmjfw
277676,279417,of the Greek Orthodox Church,VqtEppZmjfw
279417,280728,and they'd used candle wax.,VqtEppZmjfw
280728,282591,"And the candle wax was dirty,",VqtEppZmjfw
282591,283824,and we couldn't image through the wax.,VqtEppZmjfw
283824,287159,So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax.,VqtEppZmjfw
287159,289061,It's hard to tell you exactly,VqtEppZmjfw
289061,291775,"how bad this condition of this book is,",VqtEppZmjfw
291775,294541,but it came out in little bits very often.,VqtEppZmjfw
294541,296891,"And normally in a book, you wouldn't worry about the little bits,",VqtEppZmjfw
296891,299891,but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text.,VqtEppZmjfw
299891,302190,"So, tiny fragments",VqtEppZmjfw
302190,306931,we actually managed to put back in the right place.,VqtEppZmjfw
306931,310641,"Then, having done that, we started to image the manuscript.",VqtEppZmjfw
310641,312141,And we imaged the manuscript,VqtEppZmjfw
312141,314169,in 14 different wavebands of light.,VqtEppZmjfw
314169,318075,"Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light,",VqtEppZmjfw
318075,319291,you see different things.,VqtEppZmjfw
319291,320858,And here is an image of a page,VqtEppZmjfw
320858,323375,imaged in 14 different wavebands of light.,VqtEppZmjfw
323375,325508,But none of them worked.,VqtEppZmjfw
325508,329925,"So what we did was we processed the images together,",VqtEppZmjfw
329925,333225,and we put two images into one blank screen.,VqtEppZmjfw
333225,336058,And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript.,VqtEppZmjfw
336058,337874,And the image on the left,VqtEppZmjfw
337874,339225,is the normal red image.,VqtEppZmjfw
339225,341137,And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image.,VqtEppZmjfw
341137,342277,And in the image on the right,VqtEppZmjfw
342277,344725,you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.,VqtEppZmjfw
344725,347707,"If you merge them together into one digital canvas,",VqtEppZmjfw
347707,350525,the parchment is bright in both images,VqtEppZmjfw
350525,352400,and it comes out bright.,VqtEppZmjfw
352400,355416,The prayer book is dark in both images,VqtEppZmjfw
355416,357113,and it comes out dark.,VqtEppZmjfw
357113,360464,The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another.,VqtEppZmjfw
360464,362864,"And it'll come out dark but red,",VqtEppZmjfw
362864,365131,and then you can start to read it rather clearly.,VqtEppZmjfw
365131,367973,And that's what it looks like.,VqtEppZmjfw
367973,371315,"Now that's a before and after image,",VqtEppZmjfw
371315,374297,but you don't read the image on the screen like that.,VqtEppZmjfw
374297,376916,You zoom in and you zoom in,VqtEppZmjfw
376916,380464,"and you zoom in and you zoom in,",VqtEppZmjfw
380464,382532,and you can just read it now.,VqtEppZmjfw
382532,388880,(Applause),VqtEppZmjfw
388880,392460,"If you process the same two images in a different way,",VqtEppZmjfw
392460,395030,you can actually get rid of the prayer book text.,VqtEppZmjfw
395030,396048,"And this is terribly important,",VqtEppZmjfw
396048,399031,because the diagrams in the manuscript,VqtEppZmjfw
399031,401498,are the unique source for the diagrams,VqtEppZmjfw
401498,404315,that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C.,VqtEppZmjfw
404315,407354,"And there we are, I can give them to you.",VqtEppZmjfw
407354,409698,With this kind of imaging --,VqtEppZmjfw
409698,412364,"this kind of infrared, ultraviolet, invisible light imaging --",VqtEppZmjfw
412364,414964,we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries.,VqtEppZmjfw
414964,416817,How were we going to do that?,VqtEppZmjfw
416817,418780,"Well we took the manuscript,",VqtEppZmjfw
418780,423067,and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging.,VqtEppZmjfw
423067,426081,So an X-ray comes in in the diagram on the left,VqtEppZmjfw
426081,429933,and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom.,VqtEppZmjfw
429933,431931,And that electron disappears.,VqtEppZmjfw
431931,435566,"And as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out",VqtEppZmjfw
435566,438048,jumps in and takes its place.,VqtEppZmjfw
438048,439481,"And when it takes its place,",VqtEppZmjfw
439481,442315,it sheds electromagnetic radiation.,VqtEppZmjfw
442315,443747,It sheds an X-ray.,VqtEppZmjfw
443747,446398,And this X-ray is specific in its wavelength,VqtEppZmjfw
446398,448280,to the atom that it hits.,VqtEppZmjfw
448280,450448,And what we wanted to get,VqtEppZmjfw
450448,452181,was the iron.,VqtEppZmjfw
452181,454048,Because the ink was written in iron.,VqtEppZmjfw
454048,455731,And if we can map,VqtEppZmjfw
455731,458315,"where this X-ray that comes out, where it comes from,",VqtEppZmjfw
458315,460381,"we can map all the iron on the page,",VqtEppZmjfw
460381,462980,then theoretically we can read the image.,VqtEppZmjfw
462980,467315,The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this.,VqtEppZmjfw
467315,470689,So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory,VqtEppZmjfw
470689,472131,"in California,",VqtEppZmjfw
472131,473699,which is a particle accelerator.,VqtEppZmjfw
473699,475431,"Electrons go around one way,",VqtEppZmjfw
475431,477048,positrons go around the other.,VqtEppZmjfw
477048,478364,"They meet in the middle,",VqtEppZmjfw
478364,480800,and they create subatomic particles,VqtEppZmjfw
480800,483030,like the charm quark and the tau lepton.,VqtEppZmjfw
483030,486052,Now we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam.,VqtEppZmjfw
486052,489600,"But as the electrons go round at the speed of light,",VqtEppZmjfw
489600,490867,they shed X-rays.,VqtEppZmjfw
490867,493517,And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system.,VqtEppZmjfw
493517,495466,"This is called synchrotron radiation,",VqtEppZmjfw
495466,497284,and it's normally used to look at things,VqtEppZmjfw
497284,498951,like proteins and that sort of thing.,VqtEppZmjfw
498951,502948,"But we wanted it to look at atoms, at iron atoms,",VqtEppZmjfw
502948,505817,so that we could read the page from before and after.,VqtEppZmjfw
505817,508115,"And lo and behold, we found that we could do it.",VqtEppZmjfw
508115,511563,It took about 17 minutes to do a single page.,VqtEppZmjfw
511563,514218,So what did we discover?,VqtEppZmjfw
514218,516400,Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes,VqtEppZmjfw
516400,518203,"is called The Stomachion.""""",VqtEppZmjfw
518203,520617,And this didn't exist in Codices A and B.,VqtEppZmjfw
520617,523036,And we knew that it involved this square.,VqtEppZmjfw
523036,524829,"And this is a perfect square,",VqtEppZmjfw
524829,526850,and it's divided into 14 bits.,VqtEppZmjfw
526850,529633,But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits.,VqtEppZmjfw
529633,531817,And now we think we know.,VqtEppZmjfw
531817,533584,He was trying to work out,VqtEppZmjfw
533584,536117,how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits,VqtEppZmjfw
536117,538444,and still make a perfect square.,VqtEppZmjfw
538444,541946,Anyone want to guess the answer?,VqtEppZmjfw
541946,547308,"It's 17,152 divided into 536 families.",VqtEppZmjfw
547308,549675,And the important point about this,VqtEppZmjfw
549675,553389,is that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics.,VqtEppZmjfw
553389,557153,And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics.,VqtEppZmjfw
557153,560388,The really astonishing thing though about this manuscript,VqtEppZmjfw
560388,562757,is that we looked at the other manuscripts,VqtEppZmjfw
562757,564175,"that the palimpsester had made,",VqtEppZmjfw
564175,566741,"the scribe had made his book out of,",VqtEppZmjfw
566741,569673,and one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides.,VqtEppZmjfw
569673,574041,Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C.,VqtEppZmjfw
574041,576458,He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes.,VqtEppZmjfw
576458,580857,And in 338 B.C. he and Demosthenes together,VqtEppZmjfw
580857,582541,decided that they wanted to stand up,VqtEppZmjfw
582541,584541,to the military might of Philip of Macedon.,VqtEppZmjfw
584541,588190,So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon.,VqtEppZmjfw
588190,589458,"This was a bad idea,",VqtEppZmjfw
589458,592891,"because Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great,",VqtEppZmjfw
592891,595174,and they lost the battle of Chaeronea.,VqtEppZmjfw
595174,597892,Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world;,VqtEppZmjfw
597892,600642,Hyperides found himself on trial for treason.,VqtEppZmjfw
600642,604242,And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial --,VqtEppZmjfw
604242,605390,and it's a great speech:,VqtEppZmjfw
605390,607658,"Best of all,"" he says, ""is to win.""",VqtEppZmjfw
607658,609392,"But if you can't win,",VqtEppZmjfw
609392,611433,"then you should fight for a noble cause,",VqtEppZmjfw
611433,613008,because then you'll be remembered.,VqtEppZmjfw
613008,614606,Consider the Spartans.,VqtEppZmjfw
614606,616474,"They won enumerable victories,",VqtEppZmjfw
616474,618306,but no one remembers what they are,VqtEppZmjfw
618306,620441,because they were all fought for selfish ends.,VqtEppZmjfw
620441,624007,The one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers,VqtEppZmjfw
624007,625723,is the the battle of Thermopylae,VqtEppZmjfw
625723,627726,"where they were butchered to a man,",VqtEppZmjfw
627726,629658,"but fought for the freedom of Greece.""
236;629658;631923;It was such a great speech""",VqtEppZmjfw
631923,635658,that the Athenian law courts let him off.,VqtEppZmjfw
635658,637724,"He lived for another 10 years,",VqtEppZmjfw
637724,640375,then the Macedonian faction caught up with him.,VqtEppZmjfw
640375,642959,"They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory,",VqtEppZmjfw
642959,646390,and no one knows what they did with his body.,VqtEppZmjfw
646390,649541,"So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity,",VqtEppZmjfw
649541,651523,"speaking to us, not from the grave,",VqtEppZmjfw
651523,653001,"because his grave doesn't exist,",VqtEppZmjfw
653001,654774,but from the Athenian law courts.,VqtEppZmjfw
654774,656423,Now I should say at this point,VqtEppZmjfw
656423,659190,that normally when you're looking,VqtEppZmjfw
659190,661186,"at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off,",VqtEppZmjfw
661186,662672,you don't find unique texts.,VqtEppZmjfw
662672,665774,And to find two in one manuscript is really something.,VqtEppZmjfw
665774,668991,To find three is completely weird.,VqtEppZmjfw
668991,670672,And we found three.,VqtEppZmjfw

710392,712523,"if you want to ensure their long-term utility,",VqtEppZmjfw

305170,307658,I'd like to present some data to you from three questions,Qy5A8dVYU3k
307658,309868,"that I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from",Qy5A8dVYU3k
309868,312520,sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
312520,315550,There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question:,Qy5A8dVYU3k
315550,318425,"How do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad",Qy5A8dVYU3k
318425,322564,"to very good? Second, an activity question:",Qy5A8dVYU3k
322564,325092,"What are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities",Qy5A8dVYU3k
325092,328317,including things like eating and working and watching TV?,Qy5A8dVYU3k
328317,331905,And finally a mind-wandering question:,Qy5A8dVYU3k
331905,334547,Are you thinking about something other,Qy5A8dVYU3k
334547,337170,than what you're currently doing?,Qy5A8dVYU3k
337170,340612,"People could say no -- in other words, I'm focused only on my task --",Qy5A8dVYU3k
340612,343141,or yes -- I am thinking about something else --,Qy5A8dVYU3k
343141,345597,"and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
345597,347023,neutral or unpleasant.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
347023,352482,Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
352482,354947,So what did we find?,Qy5A8dVYU3k
354947,357246,"This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
357246,359486,and you can see that bar there representing how happy,Qy5A8dVYU3k

360819,362742,when they're not mind-wandering.,Qy5A8dVYU3k

373799,376221,"on average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
376221,377889,but surely when their minds are straying away,Qy5A8dVYU3k
377889,380008,"from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
380008,383772,at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
383772,386471,"Nope. As it turns out,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
386471,388163,people are less happy when they're mind-wandering,Qy5A8dVYU3k

391189,393366,people don't really like commuting to work very much.,Qy5A8dVYU3k

396126,398660,they are substantially happier when they're focused,Qy5A8dVYU3k
398660,401022,only on their commute than when their mind is going,Qy5A8dVYU3k
401022,404069,off to something else.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
404069,405851,It's amazing.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
405851,409696,"So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
409696,412094,"a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
412094,414950,"we often think about unpleasant things, and they are",Qy5A8dVYU3k
414950,418557,"enormously less happy when they do that,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
418557,421222,"our worries, our anxieties, our regrets,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
421222,424182,and yet even when people are thinking about something,Qy5A8dVYU3k
424182,427046,"neutral, they're still considerably less happy",Qy5A8dVYU3k
427046,429023,than when they're not mind-wandering at all.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
429023,431858,"Even when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
431858,434062,they're actually just slightly less happy,Qy5A8dVYU3k
434062,437319,than when they aren't mind-wandering.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
437319,439381,"If mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like",Qy5A8dVYU3k
439381,442414,"having the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars",Qy5A8dVYU3k
442414,448565,or one dollar. Right? You'd never want to play. (Laughter),Qy5A8dVYU3k
448565,451238,"So I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
451238,454050,"that mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all",Qy5A8dVYU3k
454050,456817,I've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
456817,459602,"It's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case",Qy5A8dVYU3k
459602,462056,"that when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.",Qy5A8dVYU3k
462056,464425,Maybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever,Qy5A8dVYU3k
464425,467514,disentangle these two possibilites?,Qy5A8dVYU3k
467514,469858,"Well, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact",Qy5A8dVYU3k
469858,472815,"you'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not",Qy5A8dVYU3k

476812,480242,"We're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
480242,483438,"and so we can look and see, does mind-wandering",Qy5A8dVYU3k
483438,485931,"tend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness",Qy5A8dVYU3k
485931,488114,"tend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight",Qy5A8dVYU3k

493484,497169,"mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later,",Qy5A8dVYU3k
497169,500888,consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
500888,504048,"In contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy",Qy5A8dVYU3k
504048,507057,now and mind-wandering a short time later.,Qy5A8dVYU3k
507057,509379,"In other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be",Qy5A8dVYU3k
509379,515219,"an actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.",Qy5A8dVYU3k
515219,517443,"A few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering",Qy5A8dVYU3k
517443,519706,to a slot machine you'd never want to play.,Qy5A8dVYU3k

569241,572919,"at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think,",Qy5A8dVYU3k

594850,597780,"and then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness",Qy5A8dVYU3k

177260,179260,the radiologists are heroes.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
179260,181260,There's a shortage of radiologists,DqbM1ZrpTQg
181260,183260,"qualified to read mammograms,",DqbM1ZrpTQg

200260,203260,"Where there is this much legal smoke,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
203260,206260,there is likely to be some fire.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
206260,209260,The factor most responsible for that fire,DqbM1ZrpTQg
209260,211260,is breast density.,DqbM1ZrpTQg

250260,252260,Radiologists classify breast density,DqbM1ZrpTQg

254260,257260,based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
257260,260260,"If the breast is less than 25 percent dense,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
260260,262260,that's called fatty-replaced.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
262260,264260,The next category,DqbM1ZrpTQg
264260,266260,"is scattered fibroglandular densities,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
266260,268260,followed by heterogeneously dense,DqbM1ZrpTQg
268260,270260,and extremely dense.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
270260,272260,And breasts that fall into these two categories,DqbM1ZrpTQg
272260,274260,are considered dense.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
274260,276260,The problem with breast density,DqbM1ZrpTQg
276260,279260,is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
279260,281260,Both tumors and dense breast tissue,DqbM1ZrpTQg
281260,284260,"appear white on a mammogram,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
284260,287260,and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
287260,289260,So it's easy to see this tumor,DqbM1ZrpTQg
289260,292260,in the upper part of this fatty breast.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
292260,294260,But imagine how difficult it would be,DqbM1ZrpTQg
294260,297260,to find that tumor in this dense breast.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
297260,299260,That's why mammograms find,DqbM1ZrpTQg
299260,302260,"over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
302260,305260,but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
305260,307260,Now it's bad enough that breast density,DqbM1ZrpTQg
307260,309260,"makes it hard to find a cancer,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
309260,311260,but it turns out,DqbM1ZrpTQg
311260,313260,that it's also a powerful predictor,DqbM1ZrpTQg
313260,315260,of your risk for breast cancer.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
315260,317260,It's a stronger risk factor,DqbM1ZrpTQg
317260,320260,than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
320260,323260,"At the time my patient posed this question to me,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
323260,325260,breast density was an obscure topic,DqbM1ZrpTQg
325260,327260,"in the radiology literature,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
327260,329260,"and very few women having mammograms,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
329260,331260,"or the physicians ordering them,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
331260,333260,knew about this.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
333260,335260,But what else could I offer her?,DqbM1ZrpTQg
336260,339260,"Mammograms have been around since the 1960's,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
339260,341260,and it's changed very little.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
341260,344260,"There have been surprisingly few innovations,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
344260,346260,until digital mammography was approved,DqbM1ZrpTQg
346260,348260,in 2000.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
348260,351260,"Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
351260,353260,but the images,DqbM1ZrpTQg
353260,355260,"can be stored and manipulated digitally,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
355260,358260,just like we can with a digital camera.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
358260,360260,The U.S. has invested,DqbM1ZrpTQg
360260,362260,four billion dollars,DqbM1ZrpTQg
362260,365260,"converting to digital mammography equipment,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
365260,368260,and what have we gained from that investment?,DqbM1ZrpTQg
368260,372260,"In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
372260,374260,digital mammography was found,DqbM1ZrpTQg
374260,376260,to be no better over all,DqbM1ZrpTQg
376260,378260,"than traditional mammography,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
378260,381260,"and in fact, it was worse in older women.",DqbM1ZrpTQg
381260,384260,"But it was better in one group,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
384260,386260,and that was women under 50,DqbM1ZrpTQg
386260,389260,"who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
389260,391260,"and in those women,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
391260,394260,"digital mammography found twice as many cancers,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
394260,397260,but it still only found 60 percent.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
397260,399260,So digital mammography,DqbM1ZrpTQg
399260,401260,has been a giant leap forward,DqbM1ZrpTQg
401260,403260,for manufacturers,DqbM1ZrpTQg
403260,405260,"of digital mammography equipment,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
405260,407260,but it's been a very small step forward for,DqbM1ZrpTQg
407260,409260,womankind.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
410260,412260,What about ultrasound?,DqbM1ZrpTQg
412260,414260,Ultrasound generates more biopsies,DqbM1ZrpTQg
414260,416260,"that are unnecessary relative to other technologies,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
416260,419260,so it's not widely used.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
419260,422260,"And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
422260,425260,but it's also very expensive.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
426260,429260,"If we think about disruptive technology,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
429260,431260,we see an almost ubiquitous pattern,DqbM1ZrpTQg
431260,434260,of the technology getting smaller and less expensive.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
434260,437260,Think about iPods compared to stereos.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
437260,440260,But it's the exact opposite in health care.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
440260,442260,The machines get ever bigger,DqbM1ZrpTQg
442260,444260,and ever more expensive.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
446260,449260,Screening the average young woman with an MRI,DqbM1ZrpTQg
449260,452260,is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
453260,455260,It's just way too much equipment.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
455260,457260,One MRI scan,DqbM1ZrpTQg
457260,460260,costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
460260,462260,"And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact",DqbM1ZrpTQg
462260,464260,that health care innovation,DqbM1ZrpTQg
464260,467260,can't always come at a much higher price.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
469260,471260,Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker,DqbM1ZrpTQg
471260,473260,"on innovation,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
473260,476260,and he made the case that scientific discoveries,DqbM1ZrpTQg
476260,480260,are rarely the product of one individual's genius.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
480260,483260,"Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
483260,485260,if you can simply gather,DqbM1ZrpTQg
485260,487260,people with different perspectives in a room,DqbM1ZrpTQg
487260,489260,and get them to talk about things,DqbM1ZrpTQg
489260,491260,that they don't ordinarily talk about.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
491260,494260,It's like the essence of TED.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
494260,496260,"He quotes one innovator who says,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
496260,500260,"The only time a physician and a physicist get together""",DqbM1ZrpTQg
500260,502260,"is when the physicist gets sick.""
199;502260;504260;(Laughter)""",DqbM1ZrpTQg
504260,506260,"This makes no sense,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
506260,508260,because physicians have all kinds of problems,DqbM1ZrpTQg
508260,511260,that they don't realize have solutions.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
511260,513260,And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things,DqbM1ZrpTQg
513260,516260,that they don't realize are problems.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
516260,519260,"Now, take a look at this cartoon",DqbM1ZrpTQg
519260,521260,"that accompanied Gladwell's article,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
521260,523260,and tell me if you see something disturbing,DqbM1ZrpTQg
523260,526260,about this depiction of innovative thinkers.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
526260,528260,(Laughter),DqbM1ZrpTQg
528260,532260,"So if you will allow me a little creative license,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
532260,534260,I will tell you the story,DqbM1ZrpTQg
534260,536260,of the serendipitous collision,DqbM1ZrpTQg
536260,538260,of my patient's problem,DqbM1ZrpTQg
538260,540260,with a physicist's solution.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
540260,542260,"Shortly after her visit,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
542260,544260,I was introduced to a nuclear physicist,DqbM1ZrpTQg
544260,546260,at Mayo,DqbM1ZrpTQg
546260,548260,"named Michael O'Conner,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
548260,550260,"who was a specialist in cardiac imaging,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
550260,552260,something I had nothing to do with.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
552260,554260,And he happened to tell me,DqbM1ZrpTQg
554260,557260,"about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
557260,560260,where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
560260,562260,Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time,DqbM1ZrpTQg
562260,564260,"to image the heart,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
564260,567260,and it had even been tried to image the breast.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
567260,569260,But the problem was,DqbM1ZrpTQg
569260,571260,that the gamma detectors,DqbM1ZrpTQg
571260,573260,"were these huge, bulky tubes,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
573260,575260,"and they were filled with these scintillating crystals,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
575260,578260,and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast,DqbM1ZrpTQg
578260,580260,to find small tumors.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
580260,582260,But the potential advantage was,DqbM1ZrpTQg
582260,584260,"that gamma rays, unlike X-rays,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
584260,587260,are not influenced by breast density.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
587260,589260,But this technology,DqbM1ZrpTQg
589260,591260,"could not find tumors when they're small,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
591260,594260,and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
594260,596260,If you can find a tumor,DqbM1ZrpTQg
596260,598260,"when it's less than a centimeter,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
598260,600260,"survival exceeds 90 percent,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
600260,602260,but drops off rapidly,DqbM1ZrpTQg
602260,604260,as tumor size increases.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
605260,607260,But Michael told me about,DqbM1ZrpTQg
607260,609260,"a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
609260,611260,and this is it.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
611260,613260,It's made,DqbM1ZrpTQg
613260,615260,"not of a bulky tube,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
615260,618260,but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material,DqbM1ZrpTQg
618260,620260,that serves as the gamma detector.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
620260,622260,And I started talking to him,DqbM1ZrpTQg
622260,624260,"about this problem with breast density,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
624260,627260,and we realized that we might be able to get this detector,DqbM1ZrpTQg
627260,629260,close enough around the breast,DqbM1ZrpTQg
629260,631260,to actually find small tumors.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
631260,633260,So after putting together,DqbM1ZrpTQg
633260,636260,a grid of these cubes with tape --,DqbM1ZrpTQg
636260,639260,(Laughter),DqbM1ZrpTQg
639260,642260,-- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate,DqbM1ZrpTQg
642260,644260,of a mammography machine,DqbM1ZrpTQg
644260,646260,"that was about to be thrown out,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
646260,649260,"and we attached the new detector,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
649260,651260,and we decided to call this machine,DqbM1ZrpTQg
651260,654260,"Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.",DqbM1ZrpTQg
655260,657260,This is an image from our first patient.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
657260,659260,"And you can see, using the old gamma technology,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
659260,661260,that it just looked like noise.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
661260,663260,"But using our new detector,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
663260,666260,we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
666260,668260,"So here we were, a nuclear physicist,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
668260,670260,"an internist,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
670260,673260,"soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
673260,675260,"and two radiologists,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
675260,677260,and we were trying to take on,DqbM1ZrpTQg
677260,679260,the entrenched world of mammography,DqbM1ZrpTQg
679260,682260,with a machine that was held together by duct tape.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
683260,685260,To say that we faced,DqbM1ZrpTQg
685260,687260,high doses of skepticism,DqbM1ZrpTQg
687260,689260,in those early years,DqbM1ZrpTQg
689260,691260,"is just a huge understatement,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
691260,694260,but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work,DqbM1ZrpTQg
694260,697260,that we chipped away with incremental modifications,DqbM1ZrpTQg
697260,699260,to this system.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
699260,701260,This is our current detector.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
701260,703260,And you can see that it looks a lot different.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
703260,707260,"The duct tape is gone,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
707260,709260,"and we added a second detector on top of the breast,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
709260,712260,which has further improved our tumor detection.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
712260,714260,So how does this work?,DqbM1ZrpTQg
714260,717260,The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer,DqbM1ZrpTQg
717260,720260,"that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
720260,722260,"but not by normal cells,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
722260,725260,and this is the key difference from mammography.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
725260,727260,Mammography relies on differences,DqbM1ZrpTQg
727260,730260,"in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
730260,732260,and we've seen that those differences,DqbM1ZrpTQg
732260,735260,can be obscured in a dense breast.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
735260,737260,But MBI exploits,DqbM1ZrpTQg
737260,740260,"the different molecular behavior of tumors,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
740260,743260,"and therefore, it's impervious to breast density.",DqbM1ZrpTQg
744260,746260,"After the injection,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
746260,748260,the patient's breast is placed between the detectors.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
748260,750260,And if you've ever had a mammogram --,DqbM1ZrpTQg
750260,752260,if you're old enough to have had a mammogram --,DqbM1ZrpTQg
752260,754260,you know what comes next:,DqbM1ZrpTQg
754260,756260,pain.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
756260,758260,You may be surprised to know,DqbM1ZrpTQg
758260,761260,that mammography is the only radiologic study,DqbM1ZrpTQg
761260,763260,"that's regulated by federal law,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
763260,765260,and the law requires,DqbM1ZrpTQg
765260,768260,that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery,DqbM1ZrpTQg
768260,771260,come down on your breast during this study.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
772260,774260,"But with MBI,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
774260,777260,"we use just light, pain-free compression.",DqbM1ZrpTQg
777260,783260,(Applause),DqbM1ZrpTQg
783260,785260,And the detector,DqbM1ZrpTQg
785260,787260,then transmits the image to the computer.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
787260,789260,So here's an example.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
789260,791260,"You can see, on the right, a mammogram",DqbM1ZrpTQg
791260,793260,"showing a faint tumor,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
793260,795260,the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
795260,798260,"But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
798260,800260,"as well as a second tumor,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
800260,803260,which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
804260,807260,"In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
807260,810260,we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors --,DqbM1ZrpTQg
810260,812260,one is small as three millimeters.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
813260,816260,Our big break came in 2004.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
818260,821260,"After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
821260,823260,we used these images,DqbM1ZrpTQg
823260,826260,to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
826260,829260,And we were elated when they took a chance,DqbM1ZrpTQg
829260,831260,on a team of completely unknown investigators,DqbM1ZrpTQg
831260,833260,and funded us to study,DqbM1ZrpTQg
833260,835260,"1,000 women with dense breasts,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
835260,838260,comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
838260,840260,"Of the tumors that we found,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
840260,842260,mammography found,DqbM1ZrpTQg
842260,845260,only 25 percent of those tumors.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
845260,848260,MBI found 83 percent.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
848260,851260,Here's an example from that screening study.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
851260,853260,The digital mammogram was read as normal,DqbM1ZrpTQg
853260,855260,"and shows lots of dense tissue,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
855260,858260,"but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
858260,861260,which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
861260,864260,"In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.",DqbM1ZrpTQg
864260,866260,"And in this case,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
866260,869260,"a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
869260,872260,"who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
872260,874260,wanted to enroll in our study.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
874260,877260,"And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
877260,879260,but her MBI showed an area,DqbM1ZrpTQg
879260,881260,"of worrisome uptake,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
881260,884260,which we can also see on a color image.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
884260,886260,And this corresponded,DqbM1ZrpTQg
886260,888260,to a tumor the size of a golf ball.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
888260,890260,But fortunately it was removed,DqbM1ZrpTQg
890260,893260,before it had spread to her lymph nodes.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
894260,896260,So now that we knew that this technology,DqbM1ZrpTQg
896260,899260,"could find three times more tumors in a dense breast,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
899260,902260,we had to solve one very important problem.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
902260,905260,"We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
905260,908260,and we have spent the last three years,DqbM1ZrpTQg
908260,911260,making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system,DqbM1ZrpTQg
911260,913260,to allow this.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
913260,916260,And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation,DqbM1ZrpTQg
916260,918260,that is equivalent to the effective dose,DqbM1ZrpTQg
918260,920260,from one digital mammogram.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
920260,923260,"And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
923260,926260,and this image from three weeks ago,DqbM1ZrpTQg
926260,928260,in a 67-year-old woman,DqbM1ZrpTQg
928260,930260,"shows a normal digital mammogram,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
930260,932260,but an MBI image,DqbM1ZrpTQg
932260,935260,showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
935260,938260,So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
938260,941260,It's also older women with dense tissue.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
941260,944260,And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose,DqbM1ZrpTQg
944260,947260,that's used in any other type of gamma technology.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
948260,951260,MBI generates four images per breast.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
951260,954260,MRI generates over a thousand.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
954260,956260,It takes a radiologist,DqbM1ZrpTQg
956260,958260,years of specialty training,DqbM1ZrpTQg
958260,960260,to become expert in differentiating,DqbM1ZrpTQg
960260,962260,the normal anatomic detail,DqbM1ZrpTQg
962260,964260,from the worrisome finding.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
964260,967260,But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room,DqbM1ZrpTQg
967260,970260,can find the tumor on the MBI image.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
970260,972260,But this is why MBI,DqbM1ZrpTQg
972260,974260,is so potentially disruptive --,DqbM1ZrpTQg
974260,976260,"it's as accurate as MRI,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
976260,979260,"it's far less complex to interpret,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
979260,981260,and it's a fraction of the cost.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
981260,983260,But you can understand why there may be,DqbM1ZrpTQg
983260,985260,forces in the breast-imaging world,DqbM1ZrpTQg
985260,988260,who prefer the status quo.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
989260,992260,"After achieving what we felt were remarkable results,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
992260,995260,our manuscript was rejected,DqbM1ZrpTQg
995260,997260,by four journals.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
997260,999260,"After the fourth rejection,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
999260,1001260,"we requested reconsideration of the manuscript,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1001260,1003260,because we strongly suspected,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1003260,1005260,that one of the reviewers who had rejected it,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1005260,1007260,had a financial conflict of interest,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1007260,1010260,in a competing technology.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1010260,1012260,Our manuscript was then accepted,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1012260,1015260,and will be published later this month,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1015260,1017260,in the journal Radiology.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1017260,1025260,(Applause),DqbM1ZrpTQg
1025260,1028260,"We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1028260,1030260,and then our findings will need to be replicated,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1030260,1032260,"at other institutions,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1032260,1035260,and this could take five or more years.,DqbM1ZrpTQg

1038260,1041260,"I will not benefit financially in any way,",DqbM1ZrpTQg

1044260,1047260,because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1048260,1050260,But I recognize --,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1050260,1054260,(Applause),DqbM1ZrpTQg
1054260,1057260,I recognize that the adoption of this technology,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1057260,1059260,will depend as much on economic,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1059260,1061260,and political forces,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1061260,1064260,as it will on the soundness of the science.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1064260,1067260,"The MBI unit has now been FDA approved,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1067260,1070260,but it's not yet widely available.,DqbM1ZrpTQg

1072260,1074260,"for women with dense breasts,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1074260,1076260,there are things that you should know,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1076260,1078260,to protect yourself.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1078260,1080260,"First, know your density.",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1080260,1082260,"Ninety percent of women don't,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1082260,1084260,and 95 percent of women don't know,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1084260,1087260,that it increases your breast cancer risk.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1087260,1090260,The State of Connecticut became the first and only state,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1090260,1092260,to mandate that women receive notification,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1092260,1094260,of their breast density,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1094260,1097260,after a mammogram.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1097260,1100260,"I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1100260,1102260,"last week in Chicago,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1102260,1105260,and I was stunned that there was a heated debate,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1105260,1107260,as to whether we should be telling women,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1107260,1109260,what their breast density is.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1109260,1111260,Of course we should.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1111260,1114260,"And if you don't know, please ask your doctor",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1114260,1117260,or read the details of your mammography report.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1117260,1119260,"Second, if you're pre-menopausal,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1119260,1121260,try to schedule your mammogram,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1121260,1123260,"in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1123260,1126260,when breast density is relatively lower.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1126260,1129260,"Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1129260,1132260,insist on additional imaging.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1132260,1134260,"And fourth and most important,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1134260,1137260,"the mammography debate will rage on,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1137260,1140260,but I do believe that all women 40 and older,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1140260,1142260,should have an annual mammogram.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1142260,1144260,"Mammography isn't perfect,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1144260,1146260,but it's the only test that's been proven,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1146260,1149260,to reduce mortality from breast cancer.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1149260,1151260,But this mortality banner,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1151260,1153260,is the very sword,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1153260,1156260,which mammography's most ardent advocates use,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1156260,1158260,to deter innovation.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1158260,1161260,Some women who develop breast cancer,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1161260,1163260,"die from it many years later,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1163260,1165260,"and most women, thankfully, survive.",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1165260,1167260,So it takes 10 or more years,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1167260,1169260,for any screening method,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1169260,1171260,to demonstrate a reduction,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1171260,1173260,in mortality from breast cancer.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1173260,1175260,Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1175260,1178260,to have a chance of making that claim.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1178260,1181260,It is time for us to accept,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1181260,1183260,both the extraordinary successes of mammography,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1183260,1185260,and the limitations.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1185260,1187260,We need to individualize screening,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1187260,1189260,based on density.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1189260,1191260,"For women without dense breasts,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1191260,1194260,mammography is the best choice.,DqbM1ZrpTQg

1196260,1198260,"we shouldn't abandon screening altogether,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1198260,1201260,we need to offer them something better.,DqbM1ZrpTQg

1205260,1208260,when my patient first asked me this question,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1208260,1211260,"are now both in middle school,",DqbM1ZrpTQg
1211260,1214260,and the answer has been so slow to come.,DqbM1ZrpTQg

1218260,1221260,to share this story with you.,DqbM1ZrpTQg
1221260,1223260,After undergoing biopsies,DqbM1ZrpTQg

1234260,1237260,"We can and must do better,",DqbM1ZrpTQg

236924,239815,"Now, congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm",CX_Krxq5eUI
239815,244419,"on January 3, 2006, and the first picture here is a picture",CX_Krxq5eUI
244419,248402,"of Stockholm, one of the typical streets, January 2.",CX_Krxq5eUI
248402,252215,The first day with the congestion charges looked like this.,CX_Krxq5eUI
252215,255135,This is what happens when you take away,CX_Krxq5eUI
255135,257200,20 percent of the cars from the streets.,CX_Krxq5eUI
257200,259910,You really reduce congestion quite substantially.,CX_Krxq5eUI
259910,263568,"But, well, as I said, I mean, car drivers adapt, right?",CX_Krxq5eUI
263568,266070,So after a while they would all come back because they,CX_Krxq5eUI
266070,268018,have sort of gotten used to charges.,CX_Krxq5eUI
268018,271694,Wrong again. It's now six and a half years ago,CX_Krxq5eUI
271694,273677,"since the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm,",CX_Krxq5eUI
273677,277666,and we basically have the same low traffic levels still.,CX_Krxq5eUI
277666,279937,"But you see, there's an interesting gap here in the time series",CX_Krxq5eUI
279937,281400,in 2007.,CX_Krxq5eUI
281400,283789,"Well, the thing is that, the congestion charges,",CX_Krxq5eUI
283789,286885,"they were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced",CX_Krxq5eUI
286885,290854,"in January and then abolished again at the end of July,",CX_Krxq5eUI
290854,293448,"followed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced",CX_Krxq5eUI
293448,297648,"again in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity.",CX_Krxq5eUI
297648,301785,"I mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with,",CX_Krxq5eUI
301785,303566,and we actually got to do it twice.,CX_Krxq5eUI
303566,305675,"And personally, I would like to do this every once a year or so,",CX_Krxq5eUI
305675,307163,but they won't let me do that.,CX_Krxq5eUI
307163,309348,But it was fun anyway.,CX_Krxq5eUI
309348,312733,"So, we followed up. What happened?",CX_Krxq5eUI
312733,316599,"This is the last day with the congestion charges, July 31,",CX_Krxq5eUI
316599,318377,"and you see the same street but now it's summer,",CX_Krxq5eUI
318377,320121,and summer in Stockholm is a very nice,CX_Krxq5eUI
320121,322371,"and light time of the year,",CX_Krxq5eUI
322371,325214,and the first day without the congestion charges,CX_Krxq5eUI
325214,326581,looked like this.,CX_Krxq5eUI
326581,329244,"All the cars were back again, and you even have to admire",CX_Krxq5eUI
329244,332154,the car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly.,CX_Krxq5eUI
332154,334401,The first day they all came back.,CX_Krxq5eUI
334401,339751,And this effect hanged on. So 2007 figures looked like this.,CX_Krxq5eUI
339751,342082,Now these traffic figures are really exciting,CX_Krxq5eUI
342082,344733,"and a little bit surprising and very useful to know,",CX_Krxq5eUI
344733,347492,but I would say that the most surprising slide here,CX_Krxq5eUI
347492,351522,I'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one.,CX_Krxq5eUI
351522,354853,"This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm,",CX_Krxq5eUI
354853,357522,and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced,CX_Krxq5eUI
357522,361839,"in the beginning of Spring 2006, people were fiercely against it.",CX_Krxq5eUI
361839,364867,Seventy percent of the population didn't want this.,CX_Krxq5eUI
364867,366515,But what happened when the congestion charges,CX_Krxq5eUI
366515,369976,"were there is not what you would expect, that people hated it more and more.",CX_Krxq5eUI
369976,373129,"No, on the contrary, they changed, up to a point",CX_Krxq5eUI
373129,376830,"where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges,",CX_Krxq5eUI
376830,378671,"meaning that -- I mean, let me repeat that:",CX_Krxq5eUI
378671,381478,70 percent of the population in Stockholm,CX_Krxq5eUI
381478,385471,want to keep a price for something that used to be free.,CX_Krxq5eUI
385471,389097,Okay. So why can that be? Why is that?,CX_Krxq5eUI
389097,392097,"Well, think about it this way. Who changed?",CX_Krxq5eUI
392097,394723,"I mean, the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared,",CX_Krxq5eUI
394723,396668,surely they must be discontent in a way.,CX_Krxq5eUI
396668,399002,"And where did they go? If we can understand this,",CX_Krxq5eUI
399002,403132,then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this.,CX_Krxq5eUI
403132,405534,"Well, so we did this huge interview survey",CX_Krxq5eUI
405534,407369,"with lots of travel services, and tried to figure out",CX_Krxq5eUI
407369,409124,"who changed, and where did they go?",CX_Krxq5eUI
409124,413538,And it turned out that they don't know themselves. (Laughter),CX_Krxq5eUI
413538,418386,"For some reason, the car drivers are --",CX_Krxq5eUI
418386,421882,they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do.,CX_Krxq5eUI
421882,424138,And why is that? It's because that travel patterns,CX_Krxq5eUI
424138,426537,are much less stable than you might think.,CX_Krxq5eUI
426537,429368,"Each day, people make new decisions, and people change",CX_Krxq5eUI
429368,431793,"and the world changes around them, and each day",CX_Krxq5eUI
431793,435046,all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly,CX_Krxq5eUI
435046,437013,away from rush hour car driving,CX_Krxq5eUI
437013,439597,in a way that people don't even notice.,CX_Krxq5eUI
439597,441642,They're not even aware of this themselves.,CX_Krxq5eUI
441642,444443,"And the other question, who changed their mind?",CX_Krxq5eUI
444443,446409,"Who changed their opinion, and why?",CX_Krxq5eUI
446409,448935,"So we did another interview survey, tried to figure out",CX_Krxq5eUI
448935,453311,"why people changed their mind, and what type of group changed their minds?",CX_Krxq5eUI
453311,456204,"And after analyzing the answers, it turned out that",CX_Krxq5eUI
456204,460089,more than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds.,CX_Krxq5eUI
460089,462376,They're actually confident that they have,CX_Krxq5eUI
462376,465065,liked congestion pricing all along.,CX_Krxq5eUI
465065,466784,Which means that we are now in a position,CX_Krxq5eUI
466784,469777,where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon,CX_Krxq5eUI
469777,472988,"with 20 percent, and reduced congestion by enormous numbers,",CX_Krxq5eUI
472988,476535,"and people aren't even aware that they have changed,",CX_Krxq5eUI
476535,480446,and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along.,CX_Krxq5eUI
480446,483920,This is the power of nudges when trying to solve,CX_Krxq5eUI
483920,486552,"complex social problems, and when you do that,",CX_Krxq5eUI
486552,490182,you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt.,CX_Krxq5eUI
490182,492369,You should just nudge them in the right direction.,CX_Krxq5eUI
492369,494091,"And if you do it right,",CX_Krxq5eUI
494091,496143,"people will actually embrace the change,",CX_Krxq5eUI
496143,499205,"and if you do it right, people will actually even like it.",CX_Krxq5eUI
499205,502530,Thank you. (Applause),CX_Krxq5eUI

103012.0,104401.0,and a mountain bike's good at doing this,k6qTwqiHnAM
104425.0,106240.0,"because it has a gear train,",k6qTwqiHnAM

116358.0,118406.0,"and you get less torque,

118430.0,119987.0,So the logical evolution here,k6qTwqiHnAM
120011.0,122821.0,"is to just make a wheelchair

132626.0,134878.0,And the context I'm talking about is where,k6qTwqiHnAM

in tools, doorknobs, bicycle parts.",k6qTwqiHnAM
188699.0,191461.0,"And that moment of inspiration,
that key invention moment,",k6qTwqiHnAM
191485.0,194009.0,"was when I was sitting
in front of my design notebook",k6qTwqiHnAM
194033.0,196781.0,"and I started thinking
about somebody grabbing a lever,",k6qTwqiHnAM
196805.0,198894.0,"and if they grab
near the end of the lever,",k6qTwqiHnAM
198918.0,200728.0,they can get an effectively long lever,k6qTwqiHnAM
200752.0,203553.0,"and produce a lot of torque
as they push back and forth,",k6qTwqiHnAM
203577.0,205773.0,and effectively get a low gear.,k6qTwqiHnAM
205797.0,208180.0,"And as they slide
their hand down the lever,",k6qTwqiHnAM
208204.0,211016.0,"they can push with a smaller
effective lever length,",k6qTwqiHnAM
211040.0,213136.0,"but push through a bigger
angle every stroke,",k6qTwqiHnAM
213160.0,216795.0,"which makes a faster rotational speed,
and gives you an effective high gear.",k6qTwqiHnAM
216819.0,218547.0,So what's exciting about this system,k6qTwqiHnAM
218571.0,221150.0,"is that it's really, really
mechanically simple,",k6qTwqiHnAM
221174.0,222984.0,and you could make it using technology,k6qTwqiHnAM
223008.0,224966.0,that's been around for hundreds of years.,k6qTwqiHnAM

229152.0,230868.0,"after a few years of development,",k6qTwqiHnAM
230892.0,232805.0,"we're now going into production with,",k6qTwqiHnAM
232829.0,234829.0,and this is a full-time wheelchair user --,k6qTwqiHnAM
234853.0,236370.0,"he's paralyzed -- in Guatemala,",k6qTwqiHnAM
236394.0,240369.0,"and you see he's able to traverse
pretty rough terrain.",k6qTwqiHnAM
240393.0,244900.0,"Again, the key innovation of this technology
is that when he wants to go fast,",k6qTwqiHnAM
244924.0,248955.0,"he just grabs the levers near the pivots
and goes through a big angle every stroke,",k6qTwqiHnAM
248979.0,251880.0,"and as the going gets tougher, he just
slides his hands up the levers,",k6qTwqiHnAM
251904.0,254476.0,"creates more torque, and kind
of bench-presses his way",k6qTwqiHnAM
254500.0,256662.0,out of trouble through the rough terrain.,k6qTwqiHnAM
256686.0,259674.0,"Now the big, important point here is that",k6qTwqiHnAM
259698.0,262387.0,"the person is the complex
machine in this system.",k6qTwqiHnAM
262411.0,265733.0,"It's the person that's sliding
his hands up and down the levers,",k6qTwqiHnAM
265757.0,268455.0,so the mechanism itself can be very simple,k6qTwqiHnAM
268479.0,271527.0,"and composed of bicycle parts you
can get anywhere in the world.",k6qTwqiHnAM
271551.0,273118.0,Because those bicycle parts,k6qTwqiHnAM
273142.0,275623.0,"are so ubiquitously available,
they're super-cheap.",k6qTwqiHnAM
275647.0,277803.0,"They're made by the gazillions

and analysis with user-centered design",k6qTwqiHnAM
341844.0,345197.0,"focused on the social and usage
and economic factors",k6qTwqiHnAM
345221.0,347734.0,"important to wheelchair users
in the developing countries.",k6qTwqiHnAM
347758.0,350222.0,"So I'm an academic at MIT,
and I'm a mechanical engineer,",k6qTwqiHnAM
350246.0,353770.0,"so I can do things like look at the type
of terrain you want to travel on,",k6qTwqiHnAM
353794.0,356418.0,"and figure out how much
resistance it should impose,",k6qTwqiHnAM
356442.0,359426.0,"look at the parts we have
available and mix and match them",k6qTwqiHnAM
359450.0,362071.0,"to figure out what sort
of gear trains we can use,",k6qTwqiHnAM
362095.0,365180.0,"and then look at the power and force
you can get out of your upper body",k6qTwqiHnAM
365204.0,367143.0,"to analyze how fast you should
be able to go in this chair",k6qTwqiHnAM
367167.0,369514.0,"as you put your arms
up and down the levers.",k6qTwqiHnAM
369538.0,373173.0,"So as a wet-behind-the-ears
student, excited,",k6qTwqiHnAM
373197.0,375298.0,"our team made a prototype,",k6qTwqiHnAM
375322.0,380173.0,"brought that prototype to Tanzania,
Kenya and Vietnam in 2008,",k6qTwqiHnAM
380197.0,382307.0,and found it was terrible,k6qTwqiHnAM
382331.0,384744.0,"because we didn't get
enough input from users.",k6qTwqiHnAM
384768.0,387910.0,"So because we tested it
with wheelchair users,",k6qTwqiHnAM
387934.0,390416.0,"with wheelchair manufacturers,
we got that feedback from them,",k6qTwqiHnAM
390440.0,393870.0,"not just articulating their problems,
but articulating their solutions,",k6qTwqiHnAM
393894.0,397418.0,"and worked together to go back
to the drawing board and make a new design,",k6qTwqiHnAM
397442.0,399568.0,"which we brought back
to East Africa in '09",k6qTwqiHnAM
399592.0,402413.0,"that worked a lot better than a normal
wheelchair on rough terrain,",k6qTwqiHnAM
402437.0,405295.0,"but it still didn't work well
indoors because it was too big,",k6qTwqiHnAM
405319.0,407293.0,"it was heavy, it was hard to move around,",k6qTwqiHnAM
407317.0,410847.0,"so again with that user feedback,
we went back to the drawing board,",k6qTwqiHnAM
410871.0,413162.0,"came up with a better
design, 20 pounds lighter,",k6qTwqiHnAM
413186.0,416853.0,"as narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested
that in a field trial in Guatemala,",k6qTwqiHnAM
416877.0,418877.0,and that advanced the product to the point,k6qTwqiHnAM
418901.0,422100.0,"where we have now that it's going
into production.",k6qTwqiHnAM
422124.0,424346.0,"Now also being engineering scientists,",k6qTwqiHnAM
424370.0,428228.0,"we were able to quantify the performance
benefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair,",k6qTwqiHnAM
428252.0,430868.0,"so here are some shots
of our trial in Guatemala",k6qTwqiHnAM
430892.0,434410.0,"where we tested the LFC
on village terrain,",k6qTwqiHnAM
434434.0,436434.0,"and tested people's biomechanical outputs,",k6qTwqiHnAM
436458.0,438621.0,"their oxygen consumption,
how fast they go,",k6qTwqiHnAM
438645.0,440312.0,"how much power they're putting out,",k6qTwqiHnAM
440336.0,443211.0,"both in their regular
wheelchairs and using the LFC,",k6qTwqiHnAM
443235.0,445712.0,"and we found that the LFC
is about 80 percent faster",k6qTwqiHnAM
445736.0,448070.0,"going on these terrains
than a normal wheelchair.",k6qTwqiHnAM
448094.0,451453.0,"It's also about 40 percent more
efficient than a regular wheelchair,",k6qTwqiHnAM
451477.0,453996.0,"and because of the mechanical
advantage you get from the levers,",k6qTwqiHnAM
454020.0,455925.0,you can produce 50 percent higher torque,k6qTwqiHnAM
455949.0,459909.0,"and really muscle your way
through the really, really rough terrain.",k6qTwqiHnAM
459933.0,463345.0,"Now the second lesson
that we learned in this is that",k6qTwqiHnAM
463369.0,466245.0,"the constraints on this design
really push the innovation,",k6qTwqiHnAM
466269.0,468509.0,"because we had to hit
such a low price point,",k6qTwqiHnAM
468533.0,470819.0,"because we had to make
a device that could travel",k6qTwqiHnAM
470843.0,473638.0,"on many, many types of terrain
but still be usable indoors,",k6qTwqiHnAM
473662.0,475929.0,"and be simple enough to repair,",k6qTwqiHnAM
475953.0,478296.0,"we ended up with a fundamentally
new product,",k6qTwqiHnAM
478320.0,480412.0,a new product that is an innovation,k6qTwqiHnAM
480436.0,483329.0,"in a space that really hasn't
changed in a hundred years.",k6qTwqiHnAM
483353.0,486782.0,"And these are all merits that are not
just good in the developing world.",k6qTwqiHnAM
486806.0,489221.0,Why not in countries like the U.S. too?,k6qTwqiHnAM
489245.0,490957.0,"So we teamed up with Continuum,",k6qTwqiHnAM
490981.0,492981.0,a local product design firm here in Boston,k6qTwqiHnAM
493005.0,495989.0,"to make the high-end version,
the developed world version,",k6qTwqiHnAM
496013.0,498775.0,"that we'll probably sell primarily
in the U.S. and Europe,",k6qTwqiHnAM
498799.0,501576.0,but to higher-income buyers.,k6qTwqiHnAM
501600.0,504562.0,"And the final point I want
to make is that I think",k6qTwqiHnAM
504586.0,507388.0,"this project worked
well because we engaged",k6qTwqiHnAM
507412.0,511999.0,"all the stakeholders that buy into this
project and are important to consider",k6qTwqiHnAM
512023.0,515342.0,"in bringing the technology
from inception of an idea",k6qTwqiHnAM
515366.0,519581.0,"through innovation, validation,
commercialization and dissemination,",k6qTwqiHnAM
519605.0,523326.0,"and that cycle has to start
and end with end users.",k6qTwqiHnAM
523350.0,526101.0,"These are the people that define
the requirements of the technology,",k6qTwqiHnAM
526125.0,528439.0,"and these are the people that have
to give the thumbs-up at the end,",k6qTwqiHnAM
528463.0,531083.0,"and say, Yeah, it actually works.",k6qTwqiHnAM
,,,k6qTwqiHnAM
531107.0,533013.0,"So people like me in the academic space,",k6qTwqiHnAM
533037.0,536384.0,"we can do things like innovate
and analyze and test,",k6qTwqiHnAM
536408.0,539480.0,"create data and make
bench-level prototypes,",k6qTwqiHnAM
539504.0,542647.0,"but how do you get that bench-level
prototype to commercialization?",k6qTwqiHnAM
542671.0,546059.0,"So we need gap-fillers like Continuum
that can work on commercializing,",k6qTwqiHnAM
546083.0,548845.0,"and we started a whole NGO
to bring our chair to market --",k6qTwqiHnAM
548869.0,551010.0,Global Research Innovation Technology --,k6qTwqiHnAM
551034.0,554742.0,"and then we also teamed up with a big
manufacturer in India, Pinnacle Industries,",k6qTwqiHnAM
554766.0,557005.0,"that's tooled up now
to make 500 chairs a month",k6qTwqiHnAM
557029.0,558808.0,"and will make the first
batch of 200 next month,",k6qTwqiHnAM
558832.0,560776.0,which will be delivered in India.,k6qTwqiHnAM
560800.0,563515.0,"And then finally, to get this
out to the people in scale,",k6qTwqiHnAM
563539.0,566063.0,"we teamed up with the largest
disability organization",k6qTwqiHnAM
566087.0,568350.0,"in the world, Jaipur Foot.",k6qTwqiHnAM
568374.0,570629.0,Now what's powerful about this model,k6qTwqiHnAM
570653.0,573436.0,"is when you bring together
all these stakeholders",k6qTwqiHnAM
573460.0,575405.0,that represent each link in the chain,k6qTwqiHnAM
575429.0,577946.0,from inception of an idea,k6qTwqiHnAM
577970.0,580714.0,"all the way to implementation
in the field,",k6qTwqiHnAM
580738.0,582265.0,that's where the magic happens.,k6qTwqiHnAM
582289.0,584813.0,"That's where you can take
a guy like me, an academic,",k6qTwqiHnAM
584837.0,587841.0,"but analyze and test
and create a new technology",k6qTwqiHnAM
587865.0,591377.0,"and quantitatively determine
how much better the performance is.",k6qTwqiHnAM
591401.0,594062.0,"You can connect with stakeholders
like the manufacturers",k6qTwqiHnAM
594062.0,596302.0,"and talk with them face-to-face
and leverage their",k6qTwqiHnAM
596322.0,599169.0,"local knowledge of manufacturing
practices and their clients",k6qTwqiHnAM
599193.0,601908.0,"and combine that knowledge
with our engineering knowledge",k6qTwqiHnAM
601932.0,605238.0,"to create something greater
than either of us could have done alone.",k6qTwqiHnAM
605262.0,607769.0,And then you can also engage the end user,k6qTwqiHnAM
607793.0,610555.0,"in the design process, and not
just ask him what he needs,",k6qTwqiHnAM
610579.0,613504.0,"but ask him how he thinks
it can be achieved.",k6qTwqiHnAM
613528.0,616561.0,"And this picture was taken
in India in our last field trial,",k6qTwqiHnAM
616585.0,619062.0,"where we had a 90-percent
adoption rate where people",k6qTwqiHnAM
619086.0,622668.0,"switched to using our Leveraged Freedom
Chair over their normal wheelchair,",k6qTwqiHnAM
622692.0,625629.0,"and this picture specifically is of Ashok,",k6qTwqiHnAM
625653.0,628661.0,"and Ashok had a spinal injury
when he fell out of a tree,",k6qTwqiHnAM
628685.0,631543.0,"and he had been working at a tailor,
but once he was injured",k6qTwqiHnAM
631567.0,634426.0,"he wasn't able to transport
himself from his house",k6qTwqiHnAM

in his normal wheelchair.",k6qTwqiHnAM
637250.0,638497.0,The road was too rough.,k6qTwqiHnAM

an LFC, he hopped in it,",k6qTwqiHnAM
641442.0,643502.0,"rode that kilometer, opened up his shop",k6qTwqiHnAM
643526.0,646218.0,"and soon after landed a contract
to make school uniforms",k6qTwqiHnAM
646242.0,649338.0,"and started making money, started
providing for his family again.",k6qTwqiHnAM
649362.0,651187.0,Ashok: You also encouraged me to work.,k6qTwqiHnAM
651211.0,653911.0,I rested for a day at home.,k6qTwqiHnAM
653935.0,658367.0,The next day I went to my shop.,k6qTwqiHnAM

very much for having me today.",k6qTwqiHnAM
665454.0,669454.0,(Applause),k6qTwqiHnAM
18330,21330,Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth.,TVfmUfr8VPA
21330,23330,"They've been here for billions of years,",TVfmUfr8VPA
23330,27330,and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms.,TVfmUfr8VPA
27330,30330,So they are one cell and they have this special property,TVfmUfr8VPA
30330,32330,that they only have one piece of DNA.,TVfmUfr8VPA
32330,34330,"They have very few genes,",TVfmUfr8VPA
34330,38330,and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out.,TVfmUfr8VPA
38330,40330,And the way bacteria make a living,TVfmUfr8VPA
40330,43330,"is that they consume nutrients from the environment,",TVfmUfr8VPA
43330,46330,"they grow to twice their size, they cut themselves down in the middle,",TVfmUfr8VPA
46330,49330,"and one cell becomes two, and so on and so on.",TVfmUfr8VPA
49330,53330,"They just grow and divide, and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life,",TVfmUfr8VPA
53330,55330,except that what I would argue is that you have,TVfmUfr8VPA
55330,58330,an amazing interaction with these critters.,TVfmUfr8VPA
58330,61330,"I know you guys think of yourself as humans, and this is sort of how I think of you.",TVfmUfr8VPA
61330,63330,This man is supposed to represent,TVfmUfr8VPA
63330,65330,"a generic human being,",TVfmUfr8VPA
65330,69330,and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body.,TVfmUfr8VPA
69330,72330,There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us,TVfmUfr8VPA
72330,75330,"who we are and able to do all the things that we do,",TVfmUfr8VPA
75330,78330,but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells,TVfmUfr8VPA
78330,80330,in you or on you at any moment in your life.,TVfmUfr8VPA
80330,82330,"So, 10 times more bacterial cells",TVfmUfr8VPA
82330,85330,than human cells on a human being.,TVfmUfr8VPA
85330,87330,"And of course it's the DNA that counts,",TVfmUfr8VPA
87330,89330,"so here's all the A, T, Gs and Cs",TVfmUfr8VPA
89330,92330,"that make up your genetic code, and give you all your charming characteristics.",TVfmUfr8VPA
92330,94330,"You have about 30,000 genes.",TVfmUfr8VPA
94330,97330,Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes,TVfmUfr8VPA
97330,101330,playing a role in you or on you all of your life.,TVfmUfr8VPA
101330,104330,"At the best, you're 10 percent human,",TVfmUfr8VPA
104330,106330,"but more likely about one percent human,",TVfmUfr8VPA
106330,108330,depending on which of these metrics you like.,TVfmUfr8VPA
108330,110330,"I know you think of yourself as human beings,",TVfmUfr8VPA
110330,114330,but I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial.,TVfmUfr8VPA
114330,115330,(Laughter),TVfmUfr8VPA
115330,118330,"These bacteria are not passive riders,",TVfmUfr8VPA
118330,121330,"these are incredibly important, they keep us alive.",TVfmUfr8VPA
121330,124330,They cover us in an invisible body armor,TVfmUfr8VPA
124330,126330,that keeps environmental insults out,TVfmUfr8VPA
126330,128330,so that we stay healthy.,TVfmUfr8VPA
128330,130330,"They digest our food, they make our vitamins,",TVfmUfr8VPA
130330,132330,they actually educate your immune system,TVfmUfr8VPA
132330,134330,to keep bad microbes out.,TVfmUfr8VPA
134330,136330,So they do all these amazing things,TVfmUfr8VPA
136330,140330,"that help us and are vital for keeping us alive,",TVfmUfr8VPA
140330,142330,and they never get any press for that.,TVfmUfr8VPA
142330,144330,But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of,TVfmUfr8VPA
144330,146330,terrible things as well.,TVfmUfr8VPA
146330,149330,"So, there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth",TVfmUfr8VPA
149330,152330,"that have no business being in you or on you at any time,",TVfmUfr8VPA
152330,156330,"and if they are, they make you incredibly sick.",TVfmUfr8VPA
156330,159330,"And so, the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the",TVfmUfr8VPA
159330,163330,"good things that bacteria do, or all the bad things that bacteria do.",TVfmUfr8VPA
163330,165330,The question we had is how could they do anything at all?,TVfmUfr8VPA
165330,167330,"I mean they're incredibly small,",TVfmUfr8VPA
167330,169330,you have to have a microscope to see one.,TVfmUfr8VPA
169330,172330,"They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide,",TVfmUfr8VPA
172330,177330,and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms.,TVfmUfr8VPA
177330,180330,And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact,TVfmUfr8VPA
180330,182330,on the environment,TVfmUfr8VPA
182330,184330,if they simply act as individuals.,TVfmUfr8VPA
184330,186330,And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different,TVfmUfr8VPA
186330,188330,way that bacteria live.,TVfmUfr8VPA
188330,192330,"The clue to this came from another marine bacterium,",TVfmUfr8VPA
192330,195330,and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri.,TVfmUfr8VPA
195330,198330,What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab,TVfmUfr8VPA
198330,201330,"holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium,",TVfmUfr8VPA
201330,204330,"a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean,",TVfmUfr8VPA
204330,206330,named Vibrio fischeri.,TVfmUfr8VPA
206330,209330,"This bacterium has the special property that it makes light,",TVfmUfr8VPA
209330,211330,"so it makes bioluminescence,",TVfmUfr8VPA
211330,213330,like fireflies make light.,TVfmUfr8VPA
213330,215330,We're not doing anything to the cells here.,TVfmUfr8VPA
215330,217330,"We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room,",TVfmUfr8VPA
217330,219330,and this is what we see.,TVfmUfr8VPA
219330,221330,What was actually interesting to us,TVfmUfr8VPA
221330,223330,"was not that the bacteria made light,",TVfmUfr8VPA
223330,225330,but when the bacteria made light.,TVfmUfr8VPA
225330,228330,"What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone,",TVfmUfr8VPA
228330,231330,"so when they were in dilute suspension, they made no light.",TVfmUfr8VPA
231330,233330,But when they grew to a certain cell number,TVfmUfr8VPA
233330,237330,all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously.,TVfmUfr8VPA
237330,241330,"The question that we had is how can bacteria, these primitive organisms,",TVfmUfr8VPA
241330,243330,"tell the difference from times when they're alone,",TVfmUfr8VPA
243330,245330,"and times when they're in a community,",TVfmUfr8VPA
245330,248330,and then all do something together.,TVfmUfr8VPA
248330,252330,"What we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other,",TVfmUfr8VPA
252330,254330,and they talk with a chemical language.,TVfmUfr8VPA
254330,257330,This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell.,TVfmUfr8VPA
257330,260330,When it's alone it doesn't make any light.,TVfmUfr8VPA
260330,264330,But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules,TVfmUfr8VPA
264330,266330,"that you can think of like hormones,",TVfmUfr8VPA
266330,269330,"and these are the red triangles, and when the bacteria is alone",TVfmUfr8VPA
269330,272330,the molecules just float away and so no light.,TVfmUfr8VPA
272330,274330,But when the bacteria grow and double,TVfmUfr8VPA
274330,277330,"and they're all participating in making these molecules,",TVfmUfr8VPA
277330,281330,the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule,TVfmUfr8VPA
281330,284330,increases in proportion to cell number.,TVfmUfr8VPA
284330,286330,And when the molecule hits a certain amount,TVfmUfr8VPA
286330,289330,"that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are,",TVfmUfr8VPA
289330,291330,they recognize that molecule,TVfmUfr8VPA
291330,294330,and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony.,TVfmUfr8VPA
294330,296330,That's how bioluminescence works --,TVfmUfr8VPA
296330,298330,they're talking with these chemical words.,TVfmUfr8VPA
298330,302330,The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology.,TVfmUfr8VPA
302330,305330,"Again, another plug for the animals in the ocean,",TVfmUfr8VPA
305330,308330,Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.,TVfmUfr8VPA
308330,310330,"What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid,",TVfmUfr8VPA
310330,312330,"and it's been turned on its back,",TVfmUfr8VPA
312330,315330,and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes,TVfmUfr8VPA
315330,318330,"and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells,",TVfmUfr8VPA
318330,320330,"they live in there, at high cell number",TVfmUfr8VPA
320330,322330,"that molecule is there, and they're making light.",TVfmUfr8VPA
322330,325330,The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans,TVfmUfr8VPA
325330,327330,is because it wants that light.,TVfmUfr8VPA
327330,329330,The way that this symbiosis works,TVfmUfr8VPA
329330,333330,"is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii,",TVfmUfr8VPA
333330,335330,just in sort of shallow knee-deep water.,TVfmUfr8VPA
335330,338330,"The squid is nocturnal, so during the day",TVfmUfr8VPA
338330,340330,"it buries itself in the sand and sleeps,",TVfmUfr8VPA
340330,343330,but then at night it has to come out to hunt.,TVfmUfr8VPA
343330,345330,On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight,TVfmUfr8VPA
345330,348330,that light can penetrate the depth of the water,TVfmUfr8VPA
348330,351330,"the squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water.",TVfmUfr8VPA
351330,354330,What the squid has developed is a shutter,TVfmUfr8VPA
354330,358330,that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria.,TVfmUfr8VPA
358330,360330,Then it has detectors on its back,TVfmUfr8VPA
360330,364330,so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.,TVfmUfr8VPA
364330,366330,And it opens and closes the shutter,TVfmUfr8VPA
366330,368330,so the amount of light coming out of the bottom --,TVfmUfr8VPA
368330,370330,which is made by the bacterium --,TVfmUfr8VPA
370330,372330,"exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back,",TVfmUfr8VPA
372330,374330,so the squid doesn't make a shadow.,TVfmUfr8VPA
374330,377330,It actually uses the light from the bacteria,TVfmUfr8VPA
377330,380330,to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device,TVfmUfr8VPA
380330,382330,"so predators can't see its shadow,",TVfmUfr8VPA
382330,384330,"calculate its trajectory, and eat it.",TVfmUfr8VPA
384330,387330,This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean.,TVfmUfr8VPA
387330,388330,(Laughter),TVfmUfr8VPA
388330,391330,"But then if you think about it, the squid has this terrible problem",TVfmUfr8VPA
391330,394330,"because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria",TVfmUfr8VPA
394330,396330,and it can't sustain that.,TVfmUfr8VPA
396330,398330,And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up,TVfmUfr8VPA
398330,401330,"the squid goes back to sleep, it buries itself in the sand,",TVfmUfr8VPA
401330,404330,"and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm,",TVfmUfr8VPA
404330,409330,and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria.,TVfmUfr8VPA
409330,412330,"Now the bacteria are dilute, that little hormone molecule is gone,",TVfmUfr8VPA
412330,414330,so they're not making light --,TVfmUfr8VPA
414330,416330,but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand.,TVfmUfr8VPA
416330,418330,"And as the day goes by the bacteria double,",TVfmUfr8VPA
418330,421330,"they release the molecule, and then light comes on",TVfmUfr8VPA
421330,424330,"at night, exactly when the squid wants it.",TVfmUfr8VPA
424330,427330,"First we figured out how this bacterium does this,",TVfmUfr8VPA
427330,430330,but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this,TVfmUfr8VPA
430330,432330,to figure out really what's the mechanism.,TVfmUfr8VPA
432330,436330,"And what we found -- so this is now supposed to be, again, my bacterial cell --",TVfmUfr8VPA
436330,438330,is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein --,TVfmUfr8VPA
438330,441330,that's the red box -- it's an enzyme that makes,TVfmUfr8VPA
441330,444330,"that little hormone molecule, the red triangle.",TVfmUfr8VPA
444330,446330,"And then as the cells grow, they're all releasing that molecule",TVfmUfr8VPA
446330,449330,"into the environment, so there's lots of molecule there.",TVfmUfr8VPA
449330,453330,And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface,TVfmUfr8VPA
453330,456330,that fits like a lock and key with that molecule.,TVfmUfr8VPA
456330,459330,These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells.,TVfmUfr8VPA
459330,462330,When the molecule increases to a certain amount --,TVfmUfr8VPA
462330,464330,which says something about the number of cells --,TVfmUfr8VPA
464330,466330,it locks down into that receptor,TVfmUfr8VPA
466330,468330,and information comes into the cells,TVfmUfr8VPA
468330,470330,that tells the cells to turn on,TVfmUfr8VPA
470330,473330,this collective behavior of making light.,TVfmUfr8VPA
473330,476330,Why this is interesting is because in the past decade,TVfmUfr8VPA
476330,478330,we have found that this is not just some anomaly,TVfmUfr8VPA
478330,481330,"of this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean --",TVfmUfr8VPA
481330,484330,all bacteria have systems like this.,TVfmUfr8VPA
484330,487330,So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other.,TVfmUfr8VPA
487330,490330,"They make chemical words, they recognize those words,",TVfmUfr8VPA
490330,492330,and they turn on group behaviors,TVfmUfr8VPA
492330,497330,that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison.,TVfmUfr8VPA
497330,500330,We have a fancy name for this: we call it quorum sensing.,TVfmUfr8VPA
500330,502330,"They vote with these chemical votes,",TVfmUfr8VPA
502330,506330,"the vote gets counted, and then everybody responds to the vote.",TVfmUfr8VPA
506330,508330,What's important for today's talk,TVfmUfr8VPA
508330,510330,is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors,TVfmUfr8VPA
510330,513330,that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions.,TVfmUfr8VPA
513330,516330,But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence.,TVfmUfr8VPA
516330,519330,It's not like a couple bacteria get in you,TVfmUfr8VPA
519330,521330,and they start secreting some toxins --,TVfmUfr8VPA
521330,524330,"you're enormous, that would have no effect on you. You're huge.",TVfmUfr8VPA
524330,527330,"What they do, we now understand,",TVfmUfr8VPA
527330,530330,"is they get in you, they wait, they start growing,",TVfmUfr8VPA
530330,532330,"they count themselves with these little molecules,",TVfmUfr8VPA
532330,534330,and they recognize when they have the right cell number,TVfmUfr8VPA
534330,538330,"that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together,",TVfmUfr8VPA
538330,542330,they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.,TVfmUfr8VPA
542330,546330,Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing.,TVfmUfr8VPA
546330,548330,That's how it works.,TVfmUfr8VPA
548330,551330,We also then went to look at what are these molecules --,TVfmUfr8VPA
551330,554330,these were the red triangles on my slides before.,TVfmUfr8VPA
554330,556330,This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule.,TVfmUfr8VPA
556330,558330,This is the word that it talks with.,TVfmUfr8VPA
558330,560330,"So then we started to look at other bacteria,",TVfmUfr8VPA
560330,563330,and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered.,TVfmUfr8VPA
563330,565330,What I hope you can see,TVfmUfr8VPA
565330,567330,is that the molecules are related.,TVfmUfr8VPA
567330,569330,The left-hand part of the molecule is identical,TVfmUfr8VPA
569330,572330,in every single species of bacteria.,TVfmUfr8VPA
572330,576330,But the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species.,TVfmUfr8VPA
576330,578330,What that does is to confer,TVfmUfr8VPA
578330,582330,exquisite species specificities to these languages.,TVfmUfr8VPA
582330,586330,Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other.,TVfmUfr8VPA
586330,589330,"So these are private, secret conversations.",TVfmUfr8VPA
589330,593330,These conversations are for intraspecies communication.,TVfmUfr8VPA
593330,597330,Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language,TVfmUfr8VPA
597330,601330,that allows it to count its own siblings.,TVfmUfr8VPA
601330,603330,Once we got that far we thought,TVfmUfr8VPA
603330,606330,we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors.,TVfmUfr8VPA
606330,609330,But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time,TVfmUfr8VPA
609330,612330,"bacteria don't live by themselves, they live in incredible mixtures,",TVfmUfr8VPA
612330,616330,with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria.,TVfmUfr8VPA
616330,619330,And that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin.,TVfmUfr8VPA
619330,622330,So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin.,TVfmUfr8VPA
622330,624330,"Anywhere on your body, it looks pretty much like this,",TVfmUfr8VPA
624330,628330,and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there.,TVfmUfr8VPA
628330,632330,"And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria,",TVfmUfr8VPA
632330,634330,"and it's about counting your neighbors,",TVfmUfr8VPA
634330,637330,it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species.,TVfmUfr8VPA
637330,639330,There has to be a way to take a census,TVfmUfr8VPA
639330,642330,of the rest of the bacteria in the population.,TVfmUfr8VPA
642330,644330,So we went back to molecular biology,TVfmUfr8VPA
644330,646330,"and started studying different bacteria,",TVfmUfr8VPA
646330,648330,and what we've found now is that,TVfmUfr8VPA
648330,650330,"in fact, bacteria are multilingual.",TVfmUfr8VPA
650330,653330,They all have a species-specific system --,TVfmUfr8VPA
653330,655330,"they have a molecule that says me.""""",TVfmUfr8VPA
655330,658330,"But then, running in parallel to that is a second system",TVfmUfr8VPA
658330,660330,"that we've discovered, that's generic.",TVfmUfr8VPA
660330,663330,"So, they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal",TVfmUfr8VPA
663330,665330,"and it has its own receptor,",TVfmUfr8VPA
665330,668330,and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria.,TVfmUfr8VPA
668330,670330,It's used by all different bacteria,TVfmUfr8VPA
670330,674330,and it's the language of interspecies communication.,TVfmUfr8VPA
674330,677330,What happens is that bacteria are able to count,TVfmUfr8VPA
677330,680330,how many of me and how many of you.,TVfmUfr8VPA
680330,682330,"They take that information inside,",TVfmUfr8VPA
682330,684330,and they decide what tasks to carry out,TVfmUfr8VPA
684330,688330,depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority,TVfmUfr8VPA
688330,690330,of any given population.,TVfmUfr8VPA
690330,692330,"Then again we turn to chemistry,",TVfmUfr8VPA
692330,695330,and we figured out what this generic molecule is --,TVfmUfr8VPA
695330,698330,"that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.",TVfmUfr8VPA
698330,700330,"It's a very small, five-carbon molecule.",TVfmUfr8VPA
700330,703330,What the important thing is that we learned,TVfmUfr8VPA
703330,706330,is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme,TVfmUfr8VPA
706330,708330,and makes exactly the same molecule.,TVfmUfr8VPA
708330,710330,So they're all using this molecule,TVfmUfr8VPA
710330,712330,for interspecies communication.,TVfmUfr8VPA
712330,715330,This is the bacterial Esperanto.,TVfmUfr8VPA
715330,716330,(Laughter),TVfmUfr8VPA
716330,718330,"Once we got that far, we started to learn",TVfmUfr8VPA
718330,721330,that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language.,TVfmUfr8VPA
721330,723330,But what we started to think is that maybe there is something,TVfmUfr8VPA
723330,725330,practical that we can do here as well.,TVfmUfr8VPA
725330,728330,"I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors,",TVfmUfr8VPA
728330,731330,they communicate with these molecules.,TVfmUfr8VPA
731330,734330,"Of course, I've also told you that one of the important things they do",TVfmUfr8VPA
734330,737330,is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing.,TVfmUfr8VPA
737330,739330,"We thought, what if we made these bacteria",TVfmUfr8VPA
739330,742330,so they can't talk or they can't hear?,TVfmUfr8VPA
742330,745330,Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics?,TVfmUfr8VPA
745330,747330,"Of course, you've just heard and you already know",TVfmUfr8VPA
747330,749330,that we're running out of antibiotics.,TVfmUfr8VPA
749330,752330,"Bacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now,",TVfmUfr8VPA
752330,756330,and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria.,TVfmUfr8VPA
756330,758330,"They either pop the bacterial membrane,",TVfmUfr8VPA
758330,761330,they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA.,TVfmUfr8VPA
761330,764330,We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics,TVfmUfr8VPA
764330,766330,and that selects for resistant mutants.,TVfmUfr8VPA
766330,769330,And so now of course we have this global problem,TVfmUfr8VPA
769330,771330,in infectious diseases.,TVfmUfr8VPA
771330,774330,"We thought, well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications,",TVfmUfr8VPA
774330,777330,"just make these bacteria so they can't talk, they can't count,",TVfmUfr8VPA
777330,780330,and they don't know to launch virulence.,TVfmUfr8VPA
780330,783330,"And so that's exactly what we've done, and we've sort of taken two strategies.",TVfmUfr8VPA
783330,785330,The first one is we've targeted,TVfmUfr8VPA
785330,788330,the intraspecies communication system.,TVfmUfr8VPA
788330,791330,So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules --,TVfmUfr8VPA
791330,793330,which you saw -- but they're a little bit different.,TVfmUfr8VPA
793330,795330,"And so they lock into those receptors,",TVfmUfr8VPA
795330,798330,and they jam recognition of the real thing.,TVfmUfr8VPA
798330,800330,"By targeting the red system,",TVfmUfr8VPA
800330,802330,what we are able to do is to make,TVfmUfr8VPA
802330,807330,"species-specific, or disease-specific, anti-quorum sensing molecules.",TVfmUfr8VPA
807330,810330,We've also done the same thing with the pink system.,TVfmUfr8VPA
810330,813330,We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit,TVfmUfr8VPA
813330,815330,so that we've made antagonists,TVfmUfr8VPA
815330,817330,of the interspecies communication system.,TVfmUfr8VPA
817330,822330,The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics,TVfmUfr8VPA
822330,824330,that work against all bacteria.,TVfmUfr8VPA
824330,827330,To finish I'll just show you the strategy.,TVfmUfr8VPA
827330,829330,"In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule,",TVfmUfr8VPA
829330,831330,but the logic is exactly the same.,TVfmUfr8VPA
831330,834330,"What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal,",TVfmUfr8VPA
834330,836330,"in this case, a mouse,",TVfmUfr8VPA
836330,838330,it doesn't initiate virulence right away.,TVfmUfr8VPA
838330,841330,"It gets in, it starts growing, it starts secreting",TVfmUfr8VPA
841330,843330,its quorum sensing molecules.,TVfmUfr8VPA
843330,845330,It recognizes when it has enough bacteria,TVfmUfr8VPA
845330,847330,"that now they're going to launch their attack,",TVfmUfr8VPA
847330,849330,and the animal dies.,TVfmUfr8VPA
849330,852330,"What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections,",TVfmUfr8VPA
852330,856330,but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules --,TVfmUfr8VPA
856330,858330,"so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing,",TVfmUfr8VPA
858330,861330,but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide.,TVfmUfr8VPA
861330,864330,What we now know is that if we treat the animal,TVfmUfr8VPA
864330,868330,with a pathogenic bacterium -- a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium --,TVfmUfr8VPA
868330,872330,"in the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule,",TVfmUfr8VPA
872330,874330,"in fact, the animal lives.",TVfmUfr8VPA
874330,878330,We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics,TVfmUfr8VPA
878330,880330,"and it's going to get us around, at least initially,",TVfmUfr8VPA
880330,882330,this big problem of resistance.,TVfmUfr8VPA
882330,885330,"What I hope you think, is that bacteria can talk to each other,",TVfmUfr8VPA
885330,888330,"they use chemicals as their words,",TVfmUfr8VPA
888330,891330,they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon,TVfmUfr8VPA
891330,893330,that we're just now starting to learn about.,TVfmUfr8VPA
893330,896330,Of course what that allows bacteria to do,TVfmUfr8VPA
896330,898330,is to be multicellular.,TVfmUfr8VPA
898330,901330,So in the spirit of TED they're doing things together,TVfmUfr8VPA
901330,903330,because it makes a difference.,TVfmUfr8VPA
903330,907330,"What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors,",TVfmUfr8VPA
907330,909330,and they can carry out tasks,TVfmUfr8VPA
909330,911330,that they could never accomplish,TVfmUfr8VPA
911330,913330,if they simply acted as individuals.,TVfmUfr8VPA
913330,916330,What I would hope that I could further argue to you,TVfmUfr8VPA
916330,919330,is that this is the invention of multicellularity.,TVfmUfr8VPA
919330,923330,Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years;,TVfmUfr8VPA
923330,925330,"humans, couple hundred thousand.",TVfmUfr8VPA
925330,927330,We think bacteria made the rules,TVfmUfr8VPA
927330,930330,for how multicellular organization works.,TVfmUfr8VPA
930330,933330,"We think, by studying bacteria,",TVfmUfr8VPA
933330,937330,we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body.,TVfmUfr8VPA
937330,939330,"We know that the principles and the rules,",TVfmUfr8VPA
939330,941330,"if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms,",TVfmUfr8VPA
941330,943330,the hope is that they will be applied,TVfmUfr8VPA
943330,947330,to other human diseases and human behaviors as well.,TVfmUfr8VPA
947330,949330,I hope that what you've learned,TVfmUfr8VPA
949330,952330,is that bacteria can distinguish self from other.,TVfmUfr8VPA
952330,955330,"By using these two molecules they can say me"" and they can say ""you.""""",TVfmUfr8VPA
955330,957330,"Again of course that's what we do,",TVfmUfr8VPA
957330,959330,"both in a molecular way,",TVfmUfr8VPA
959330,961330,"and also in an outward way,",TVfmUfr8VPA
961330,963330,but I think about the molecular stuff.,TVfmUfr8VPA
963330,965330,This is exactly what happens in your body.,TVfmUfr8VPA
965330,968330,"It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day,",TVfmUfr8VPA
968330,971330,"and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on,",TVfmUfr8VPA
971330,974330,"these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is,",TVfmUfr8VPA
974330,976330,and what their tasks should be.,TVfmUfr8VPA
976330,979330,"Again, we think that bacteria invented that,",TVfmUfr8VPA
979330,982330,"and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles,",TVfmUfr8VPA
982330,986330,but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study.,TVfmUfr8VPA
986330,990330,"The final thing is, again just to reiterate that there's this practical part,",TVfmUfr8VPA
990330,993330,and so we've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules,TVfmUfr8VPA
993330,996330,that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics.,TVfmUfr8VPA
996330,999330,"But then, to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria",TVfmUfr8VPA
999330,1001330,"that live on the Earth,",TVfmUfr8VPA
1001330,1003330,we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules.,TVfmUfr8VPA
1003330,1006330,"So, we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.",TVfmUfr8VPA
1006330,1010330,Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells,TVfmUfr8VPA
1010330,1012330,"in you or on you, keeping you healthy.",TVfmUfr8VPA
1012330,1015330,What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation,TVfmUfr8VPA
1015330,1018330,"of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you,",TVfmUfr8VPA
1018330,1020330,"in the hopes of making you more healthy,",TVfmUfr8VPA
1020330,1022330,"making those conversations better,",TVfmUfr8VPA
1022330,1025330,so bacteria can do things that we want them to do,TVfmUfr8VPA
1025330,1028330,better than they would be on their own.,TVfmUfr8VPA
1028330,1030330,"Finally, I wanted to show you",TVfmUfr8VPA
1030330,1032330,"this is my gang at Princeton, New Jersey.",TVfmUfr8VPA
1032330,1036330,Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture.,TVfmUfr8VPA

1038330,1040330,like about how the natural world works --,TVfmUfr8VPA
1040330,1043330,I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper,TVfmUfr8VPA

324537,329774,"that the population will reach
about 10 billion by 2050,",c8WMM_PUOj0
329798,332979,"and we're projecting that we will need
to increase food production",c8WMM_PUOj0
333003,334575,by 70 percent.,c8WMM_PUOj0
335182,338420,"In addition, we will need many more

341571,344234,So how will we scale to meet that demand?,c8WMM_PUOj0
344669,350166,"Well, modern agriculture simply cannot
sustainably scale to meet that demand.",c8WMM_PUOj0
350760,352978,There are a number of reasons why.,c8WMM_PUOj0
353309,358145,"One of them is that modern agriculture
is one of the largest emitters",c8WMM_PUOj0
358169,359750,of greenhouse gases.,c8WMM_PUOj0
359774,363397,"In fact, it emits more greenhouse gases",c8WMM_PUOj0

366549,368985,and our trains combined.,c8WMM_PUOj0
369009,374525,"Another reason is that modern ag
simply takes up a whole lot of land.",c8WMM_PUOj0
374549,380748,"We have cleared 19.4 million square miles
for crops and livestock.",c8WMM_PUOj0
381446,383094,What does that look like?,c8WMM_PUOj0
383118,388009,"Well, that's roughly the size
of South America and Africa combined.",c8WMM_PUOj0
389041,391300,Let me give you a specific example.,c8WMM_PUOj0
391324,396280,"In Indonesia, an amount
of virgin rainforest was cleared",c8WMM_PUOj0
396304,399686,"totaling the size

411145,413794,"And a natural carbon sink
was also removed.",c8WMM_PUOj0
414437,416423,So let me make this real for you.,c8WMM_PUOj0
416896,420741,"This clearing happened primarily
to make room for palm plantations.",c8WMM_PUOj0
421399,422774,"And as I mentioned before,",c8WMM_PUOj0

433671,436898,"And that includes things
like ice cream, cookies ...",c8WMM_PUOj0
437506,439373,It includes cooking oils.,c8WMM_PUOj0

763000,767000,the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system.,IoRjz8iTVoo
767000,772000,"So when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective,",IoRjz8iTVoo
772000,774000,"we see energy as physics, chemistry as mass,",IoRjz8iTVoo
774000,776000,"and all of a sudden, you get this biology.",IoRjz8iTVoo
776000,779000,"And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem,",IoRjz8iTVoo
779000,782000,"but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through",IoRjz8iTVoo
782000,785000,"all these toxic materials that we disgorge,",IoRjz8iTVoo
785000,787000,we will never be able to recover that.,IoRjz8iTVoo
787000,789000,"And as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years",IoRjz8iTVoo
789000,792000,"after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson,",IoRjz8iTVoo
792000,796000,that life itself has to have growth as a precondition --,IoRjz8iTVoo
796000,798000,"it has to have free energy, sunlight",IoRjz8iTVoo
798000,801000,and it needs to be an open system of chemicals.,IoRjz8iTVoo
801000,804000,"So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing,",IoRjz8iTVoo
804000,806000,"and we want growth, we want free energy from sunlight",IoRjz8iTVoo
806000,809000,and we want an open metabolism for chemicals.,IoRjz8iTVoo
809000,811000,"Then, the question becomes not growth or no growth,",IoRjz8iTVoo
811000,814000,but what do you want to grow?,IoRjz8iTVoo
814000,816000,"So instead of just growing destruction,",IoRjz8iTVoo
816000,818000,"we want to grow the things that we might enjoy,",IoRjz8iTVoo
818000,821000,and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.,IoRjz8iTVoo
821000,825000,"So therefore, we have these two metabolisms,",IoRjz8iTVoo
825000,827000,"and I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart,",IoRjz8iTVoo
827000,829000,and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms.,IoRjz8iTVoo
829000,831000,"The biological one I'm sure you understand,",IoRjz8iTVoo
831000,833000,"but also the technical one, where we take materials",IoRjz8iTVoo
833000,835000,and put them into closed cycles.,IoRjz8iTVoo
835000,838000,We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition.,IoRjz8iTVoo
838000,842000,Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition.,IoRjz8iTVoo
842000,845000,"Biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans,",IoRjz8iTVoo
845000,847000,"which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton,",IoRjz8iTVoo
847000,850000,the world would run out of cork and dry up.,IoRjz8iTVoo
850000,852000,"So we need materials in closed cycles,",IoRjz8iTVoo
852000,854000,but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million,IoRjz8iTVoo
854000,857000,"for cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects,",IoRjz8iTVoo
857000,860000,"disruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence,",IoRjz8iTVoo
860000,863000,"heavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them",IoRjz8iTVoo
863000,865000,and their production and so on.,IoRjz8iTVoo
865000,869000,"Our first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals",IoRjz8iTVoo
869000,870000,in the textile industry.,IoRjz8iTVoo
870000,875000,"Using those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.]",IoRjz8iTVoo
875000,877000,We were left with 38 chemicals.,IoRjz8iTVoo
877000,880000,We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals,IoRjz8iTVoo
880000,885000,"in human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks.",IoRjz8iTVoo
885000,887000,So designers all over the world can analyze their products,IoRjz8iTVoo

892000,897000,(Applause),IoRjz8iTVoo

900000,903000,"these same messages all the way through their supply chains,",IoRjz8iTVoo
903000,906000,because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars,IoRjz8iTVoo

1012000,1014000,based on cradle to cradle as templates.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1014000,1017000,Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing,IoRjz8iTVoo

1036000,1038000,send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- Wal-Mart --,IoRjz8iTVoo

1063000,1066000,It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape.,IoRjz8iTVoo

1069000,1073000,"This is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph.",IoRjz8iTVoo

1076000,1078000,and here's our proposal.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1078000,1082000,(Applause),IoRjz8iTVoo
1082000,1084000,So the way we approached this,IoRjz8iTVoo
1084000,1086000,is we studied the hydrology very carefully.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1086000,1088000,"We studied the biota, the ancient biota,",IoRjz8iTVoo
1088000,1090000,the current farming and the protocols.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1090000,1092000,We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city,IoRjz8iTVoo
1092000,1098000,"will have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlight",IoRjz8iTVoo
1098000,1101000,in every single apartment at some point during the day.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1101000,1105000,We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1105000,1108000,We lay out the building areas.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1108000,1109000,We start to integrate commercial and mixed use,IoRjz8iTVoo
1109000,1112000,so the people all have centers and places to be.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1112000,1114000,"The transportation is all very simple,",IoRjz8iTVoo
1114000,1117000,everybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1117000,1122000,"We have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive.",IoRjz8iTVoo
1122000,1124000,The waste systems all connect.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1124000,1129000,"If you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants,",IoRjz8iTVoo
1129000,1131000,"which are sold as assets, not liabilities.",IoRjz8iTVoo
1131000,1135000,Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas?,IoRjz8iTVoo
1135000,1140000,The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1140000,1144000,"And then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city",IoRjz8iTVoo
1144000,1148000,to power the fuel for the cooking for the city.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1148000,1150000,So this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1150000,1153000,And then the compost is all taken back,IoRjz8iTVoo
1153000,1155000,"to the roofs of the city, where we've got farming,",IoRjz8iTVoo
1155000,1159000,"because what we've done is lifted up the city,",IoRjz8iTVoo
1159000,1166000,"the landscape, into the air to -- to restore the native landscape",IoRjz8iTVoo
1166000,1168000,on the roofs of the buildings.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1168000,1171000,The solar power of all the factory centers,IoRjz8iTVoo
1171000,1174000,and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1174000,1176000,And this is the concept for the top of the city.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1176000,1180000,We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1180000,1184000,The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1184000,1188000,We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors.,IoRjz8iTVoo
1188000,1193000,"And so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.",IoRjz8iTVoo

277089,280852,how smart materials work and what they are made of?,_QwRsVyk7us
280852,285030,"First of all, because we can't shape what we don't understand,",_QwRsVyk7us
285030,287382,and what we don't understand and use,_QwRsVyk7us
287382,289590,ends up shaping us.,_QwRsVyk7us
289590,292342,"The objects we use, the clothes we wear,",_QwRsVyk7us

302630,305989,we should know and understand them.,_QwRsVyk7us
305989,308333,"Secondly, and just as important,",_QwRsVyk7us
308333,311693,innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers.,_QwRsVyk7us
311693,315078,"So many times, amateurs, not experts,",_QwRsVyk7us
315078,317397,have been the inventors and improvers,_QwRsVyk7us
317397,319877,of things ranging from mountain bikes,_QwRsVyk7us
319877,323189,"to semiconductors, personal computers,",_QwRsVyk7us
323189,326128,airplanes.,_QwRsVyk7us
326128,330157,The biggest challenge is that material science is complex,_QwRsVyk7us
330157,332653,and requires expensive equipment.,_QwRsVyk7us
332653,334821,But that's not always the case.,_QwRsVyk7us
334821,338409,Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this,_QwRsVyk7us
338409,341009,when they published a paper on a simpler method,_QwRsVyk7us
341009,343429,for making conductive ink.,_QwRsVyk7us
343429,345341,"Jordan Bunker, who had had",_QwRsVyk7us
345341,348301,"no experience with chemistry until then,",_QwRsVyk7us
348301,351088,read this paper and reproduced the experiment,_QwRsVyk7us
351088,355477,at his maker space using only off-the-shelf substances,_QwRsVyk7us
355477,357069,and tools.,_QwRsVyk7us
357069,358670,"He used a toaster oven,",_QwRsVyk7us
358670,361636,"and he even made his own vortex mixer,",_QwRsVyk7us
361636,365671,based on a tutorial by another scientist/maker.,_QwRsVyk7us
365671,368423,"Jordan then published his results online,",_QwRsVyk7us
368423,371911,"including all the things he had tried and didn't work,",_QwRsVyk7us
371911,375055,so others could study and reproduce it.,_QwRsVyk7us
375055,377727,So Jordan's main form of innovation,_QwRsVyk7us
377727,381606,was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab,_QwRsVyk7us
381606,383108,at the university,_QwRsVyk7us
383108,386295,and recreate it in a garage in Chicago,_QwRsVyk7us
386295,390556,using only cheap materials and tools he made himself.,_QwRsVyk7us
390556,392829,"And now that he published this work,",_QwRsVyk7us
392829,394553,others can pick up where he left,_QwRsVyk7us
394553,399097,and devise even simpler processes and improvements.,_QwRsVyk7us
399097,401313,Another example I'd like to mention,_QwRsVyk7us
401313,404978,is Hannah Perner-Wilson's Kit-of-No-Parts.,_QwRsVyk7us
404978,407858,Her project's goal is to highlight,_QwRsVyk7us
407858,410330,the expressive qualities of materials,_QwRsVyk7us
410330,415354,while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder.,_QwRsVyk7us
415354,417794,Electronics kits are very powerful,_QwRsVyk7us
417794,420346,"in that they teach us how things work,",_QwRsVyk7us
420346,423322,but the constraints inherent in their design,_QwRsVyk7us
423322,425482,influence the way we learn.,_QwRsVyk7us
425482,427970,"So Hannah's approach, on the other hand,",_QwRsVyk7us
427970,431186,is to formulate a series of techniques,_QwRsVyk7us
431186,433885,for creating unusual objects,_QwRsVyk7us
433885,436690,that free us from pre-designed constraints,_QwRsVyk7us
436690,440101,by teaching us about the materials themselves.,_QwRsVyk7us
440101,442834,"So amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments,",_QwRsVyk7us
442834,444804,this is one of my favorites.,_QwRsVyk7us
444804,448221,"[Paper speakers""]""",_QwRsVyk7us
448221,451499,What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper,_QwRsVyk7us
451499,455941,with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player,_QwRsVyk7us
455941,457594,and a magnet.,_QwRsVyk7us
457594,465243,"(Music: Happy Together"")""",_QwRsVyk7us
468191,472027,"So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT,",_QwRsVyk7us
472027,474810,Hannah created a series of paper speakers,_QwRsVyk7us
474810,477213,out of a wide range of materials,_QwRsVyk7us
477213,481488,from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink.,_QwRsVyk7us
481488,484224,"Just like Jordan and so many other makers,",_QwRsVyk7us
484224,485851,Hannah published her recipes,_QwRsVyk7us
485851,490985,and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.,_QwRsVyk7us
490985,494189,But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches,_QwRsVyk7us
494189,495996,of material science,_QwRsVyk7us
495996,500198,in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics.,_QwRsVyk7us
500198,502754,"So Hannah's artisanal work,",_QwRsVyk7us
502754,505002,"and the fact that she shared her findings,",_QwRsVyk7us
505002,508822,opens the doors to a series of new possibilities,_QwRsVyk7us
508822,514262,that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative.,_QwRsVyk7us
514262,517167,So the interesting thing about makers,_QwRsVyk7us
517167,520210,"is that we create out of passion and curiosity,",_QwRsVyk7us
520210,522289,and we are not afraid to fail.,_QwRsVyk7us
522289,526177,"We often tackle problems from unconventional angles,",_QwRsVyk7us
526177,529166,"and, in the process, end up discovering alternatives",_QwRsVyk7us
529166,531598,or even better ways to do things.,_QwRsVyk7us
531598,535366,"So the more people experiment with materials,",_QwRsVyk7us
535366,538842,"the more researchers are willing to share their research,",_QwRsVyk7us
538842,541282,"and manufacturers their knowledge,",_QwRsVyk7us
541282,544122,the better chances we have to create technologies,_QwRsVyk7us
544122,547060,that truly serve us all.,_QwRsVyk7us
547060,549553,So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have,_QwRsVyk7us

12601.0,14610.0,I'm an artist and I cut books.,mqovAg11q-c
14610.0,16316.0,This is one of my first book works.,mqovAg11q-c
16316.0,18340.0,It's called Alternate,mqovAg11q-c
,,,mqovAg11q-c
18340.0,22132.0,"I wanted to create a stack of books so
that somebody could come into the gallery",mqovAg11q-c
22132.0,24952.0,"and think they're just looking
at a regular stack of books,",mqovAg11q-c
24952.0,28441.0,"but then as they got closer they would
see this rough hole carved into it,",mqovAg11q-c
28441.0,30417.0,"and wonder what was happening,
wonder why,",mqovAg11q-c
30417.0,32453.0,and think about the material of the book.,mqovAg11q-c
32453.0,34543.0,"So I'm interested in the texture,",mqovAg11q-c
34543.0,38663.0,"but I'm more interested in the text
and the images that we find within books.",mqovAg11q-c
39623.0,43524.0,"In most of my work, what I do is I seal
the edges of a book with a thick varnish",mqovAg11q-c
43524.0,46334.0,"so it's creating sort of a skin
on the outside of the book",mqovAg11q-c
46334.0,50202.0,"so it becomes a solid material,
but then the pages inside are still loose,",mqovAg11q-c
50202.0,52352.0,"and then I carve
into the surface of the book,",mqovAg11q-c
52352.0,54883.0,and I'm not moving or adding anything.,mqovAg11q-c
54883.0,57762.0,"I'm just carving around
whatever I find interesting.",mqovAg11q-c
57762.0,60223.0,"So everything you see
within the finished piece",mqovAg11q-c
60223.0,62996.0,"is exactly where it was
in the book before I began.",mqovAg11q-c
64666.0,67014.0,"I think of my work as sort of
a remix, in a way,",mqovAg11q-c
67014.0,69345.0,"because I'm working with
somebody else's material",mqovAg11q-c

that's more new and more contemporary.",mqovAg11q-c
85915.0,89781.0,"I'm thinking also about breaking out
of the box of the traditional book",mqovAg11q-c
89781.0,91917.0,"and pushing that linear format,",mqovAg11q-c
91917.0,95900.0,"and try to push the structure
of the book itself",mqovAg11q-c
95900.0,98423.0,"so that the book can become
fully sculptural.",mqovAg11q-c
101303.0,105068.0,"I'm using clamps and ropes

105068.0,108040.0,"in order to hold things
in place before I varnish",mqovAg11q-c
108040.0,110600.0,"so that I can push the form
before I begin,",mqovAg11q-c
110600.0,115242.0,"so that something like this
can become a piece like this,",mqovAg11q-c
115242.0,118130.0,"which is just made
from a single dictionary.",mqovAg11q-c
118130.0,124368.0,"Or something like this
can become a piece like this.",mqovAg11q-c
126768.0,128244.0,"Or something like this,",mqovAg11q-c
128244.0,132255.0,"which who knows what that's going to be

132255.0,136274.0,will become a piece like this.,mqovAg11q-c
136997.0,140685.0,"So I think one of the reasons
people are disturbed by destroying books,",mqovAg11q-c
140685.0,142228.0,people don't want to rip books,mqovAg11q-c
142228.0,144359.0,"and nobody really wants
to throw away a book,",mqovAg11q-c
144359.0,146552.0,"is that we think about books
as living things,",mqovAg11q-c

to relate to our body, as far as scale,",mqovAg11q-c
151313.0,153741.0,"but they also have the potential
to continue to grow",mqovAg11q-c
153741.0,155731.0,and to continue to become new things.,mqovAg11q-c
155731.0,158458.0,So books really are alive.,mqovAg11q-c
158458.0,160988.0,"So I think of the book as a body,",mqovAg11q-c
160988.0,163692.0,and I think of the book as a technology.,mqovAg11q-c
163692.0,166081.0,I think of the book as a tool.,mqovAg11q-c
168111.0,172435.0,And I also think of the book as a machine.,mqovAg11q-c
172435.0,174809.0,I also think of the book as a landscape.,mqovAg11q-c
174809.0,179081.0,"This is a full set of encyclopedias
that's been connected and sanded together,",mqovAg11q-c
179081.0,181334.0,"and as I carve through it,",mqovAg11q-c
181334.0,183275.0,I'm deciding what I want to choose.,mqovAg11q-c
183275.0,185863.0,"So with encyclopedias,
I could have chosen anything,",mqovAg11q-c
185863.0,188530.0,"but I specifically chose
images of landscapes.",mqovAg11q-c
190030.0,192966.0,"And with the material itself,
I'm using sandpaper",mqovAg11q-c
192966.0,196658.0,"and sanding the edges
so not only the images suggest landscape,",mqovAg11q-c
196658.0,199366.0,"but the material itself
suggests a landscape as well.",mqovAg11q-c
201456.0,204889.0,"So one of the things I do
is when I'm carving through the book,",mqovAg11q-c
204889.0,208570.0,"I'm thinking about images,
but I'm also thinking about text,",mqovAg11q-c
208570.0,210775.0,"and I think about them
in a very similar way,",mqovAg11q-c
210775.0,213647.0,"because what's interesting
is that when we're reading text,",mqovAg11q-c
213647.0,215146.0,"when we're reading a book,",mqovAg11q-c
215146.0,216615.0,"it puts images in our head,",mqovAg11q-c
216615.0,218638.0,so we're sort of filling that piece.,mqovAg11q-c
218638.0,222039.0,"We're sort of creating images
when we're reading text,",mqovAg11q-c
222039.0,224916.0,"and when we're looking at an image,
we actually use language",mqovAg11q-c
224916.0,227632.0,"in order to understand
what we're looking at.",mqovAg11q-c
227632.0,229861.0,"So there's sort of
a yin-yang that happens,",mqovAg11q-c
229861.0,231138.0,sort of a flip flop.,mqovAg11q-c
231138.0,236677.0,"So I'm creating a piece
that the viewer is completing themselves.",mqovAg11q-c
237477.0,240960.0,"And I think of my work
as almost an archaeology.",mqovAg11q-c
240960.0,243979.0,"I'm excavating and I'm trying
to maximize the potential",mqovAg11q-c
243979.0,246068.0,and discover as much as I possibly can,mqovAg11q-c
246068.0,248709.0,and exposing it within my own work.,mqovAg11q-c
250219.0,251896.0,"But at the same time,",mqovAg11q-c
251896.0,253870.0,"I'm thinking about this idea of erasure,",mqovAg11q-c
253870.0,258351.0,"and what's happening now that most
of our information is intangible,",mqovAg11q-c
258351.0,261393.0,"and this idea of loss,",mqovAg11q-c
261393.0,265711.0,"and this idea that not only is the format
constantly shifting within computers,",mqovAg11q-c
265711.0,268033.0,"but the information itself,",mqovAg11q-c
268033.0,270262.0,"now that we don't have a physical backup,",mqovAg11q-c
270262.0,275843.0,"has to be constantly updated
in order to not lose it.",mqovAg11q-c
275843.0,278623.0,"And I have several dictionaries
in my own studio,",mqovAg11q-c
278623.0,281140.0,"and I do use a computer every day,",mqovAg11q-c

I'll go on the computer,",mqovAg11q-c
283933.0,287259.0,"because I can go directly
and instantly to what I'm looking up.",mqovAg11q-c
287259.0,289209.0,I think that the book was never really,mqovAg11q-c
289209.0,292204.0,"the right format
for nonlinear information,",mqovAg11q-c
292204.0,294278.0,which is why we're seeing reference books,mqovAg11q-c
294278.0,298153.0,"becoming the first to be
endangered or extinct.",mqovAg11q-c
301743.0,304510.0,"So I don't think that the book
will ever really die.",mqovAg11q-c
304510.0,308806.0,"People think that now that we have
digital technology,",mqovAg11q-c
308806.0,310178.0,"the book is going to die,",mqovAg11q-c

313381.0,315505.0,"I think that the book will evolve,",mqovAg11q-c
315505.0,318767.0,"and just like people said
painting would die",mqovAg11q-c
318767.0,323167.0,"when photography and printmaking
became everyday materials,",mqovAg11q-c
323167.0,325154.0,but what it really allowed painting to do,mqovAg11q-c
325154.0,327706.0,"was it allowed painting
to quit its day job.",mqovAg11q-c
327706.0,334021.0,"It allowed painting to not have to have
that everyday chore of telling the story,",mqovAg11q-c
334022.0,337435.0,"and painting became free

337435.0,339512.0,"and that's when we saw Modernism emerge,",mqovAg11q-c
339512.0,341754.0,"and we saw painting
go into different branches.",mqovAg11q-c

happening with books now,",mqovAg11q-c

28000,31000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
31000,34000,Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.,2HgL5OFip-0
34000,37000,"And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it.",2HgL5OFip-0
37000,39000,But it slightly bores me.,2HgL5OFip-0
39000,41000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
41000,46000,"And, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something --",2HgL5OFip-0
46000,48000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
48000,51000,"-- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made,",2HgL5OFip-0
51000,53000,and why Francis and I found it.,2HgL5OFip-0
53000,57000,"And then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say",2HgL5OFip-0
57000,61000,what makes me tick now.,2HgL5OFip-0
61000,66000,In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.,2HgL5OFip-0
66000,69000,"I was at the University of Chicago, in my third year,",2HgL5OFip-0
69000,75000,and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago,2HgL5OFip-0
75000,77000,let you in after two years of high school.,2HgL5OFip-0
77000,83000,So you -- it was fun to get away from high school -- (Laughter) --,2HgL5OFip-0
83000,86000,"because I was very small, and I was no good in sports,",2HgL5OFip-0
86000,87000,or anything like that.,2HgL5OFip-0
87000,93000,"But I should say that my background -- my father was, you know,",2HgL5OFip-0
93000,95000,"raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican,",2HgL5OFip-0
95000,100000,"but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.",2HgL5OFip-0
100000,103000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
103000,105000,"And my mother was Irish Catholic,",2HgL5OFip-0
105000,110000,and -- but she didn't take religion too seriously.,2HgL5OFip-0
110000,114000,"And by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass,",2HgL5OFip-0
114000,118000,and going on birdwatching walks with my father.,2HgL5OFip-0
118000,122000,"So early on, I heard of Charles Darwin.",2HgL5OFip-0
122000,125000,"I guess, you know, he was the big hero.",2HgL5OFip-0
125000,131000,"And, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.",2HgL5OFip-0
131000,135000,"And at the University of Chicago I was a zoology major,",2HgL5OFip-0
135000,138000,"and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough,",2HgL5OFip-0
138000,143000,maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.,2HgL5OFip-0
143000,149000,"Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book",2HgL5OFip-0
149000,153000,"called What is Life?"" by the great physicist, Schrodinger.""",2HgL5OFip-0
153000,156000,"And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.",2HgL5OFip-0
156000,159000,"You know, Darwin explained life after it got started,",2HgL5OFip-0
159000,161000,but what was the essence of life?,2HgL5OFip-0
161000,165000,And Schrodinger said the essence was information,2HgL5OFip-0
165000,169000,"present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present",2HgL5OFip-0
169000,175000,on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.,2HgL5OFip-0
175000,179000,"You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule,",2HgL5OFip-0
179000,182000,and somehow all the information was probably present,2HgL5OFip-0
182000,186000,in some digital form. And there was the big question,2HgL5OFip-0
186000,188000,"of, how did you copy the information?",2HgL5OFip-0
188000,193000,"So that was the book. And so, from that moment on,",2HgL5OFip-0
193000,198000,I wanted to be a geneticist --,2HgL5OFip-0
198000,200000,"understand the gene and, through that, understand life.",2HgL5OFip-0
200000,205000,"So I had, you know, a hero at a distance.",2HgL5OFip-0
205000,207000,It wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling.,2HgL5OFip-0
207000,213000,And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down.,2HgL5OFip-0
213000,215000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
215000,216000,"So I went to Indiana,",2HgL5OFip-0
216000,219000,"which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics,",2HgL5OFip-0
219000,223000,"and besides, they had a really good basketball team. (Laughter)",2HgL5OFip-0
223000,226000,So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana.,2HgL5OFip-0
226000,229000,And it was at Indiana I got the impression,2HgL5OFip-0
229000,231000,"that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA.",2HgL5OFip-0
231000,235000,"And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.",2HgL5OFip-0
235000,241000,"So I first went to Copenhagen because I thought, well,",2HgL5OFip-0
241000,242000,"maybe I could become a biochemist,",2HgL5OFip-0
242000,245000,but I discovered biochemistry was very boring.,2HgL5OFip-0
245000,249000,"It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was;",2HgL5OFip-0
249000,253000,"it was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book.",2HgL5OFip-0
253000,255000,You can read it in about two hours.,2HgL5OFip-0
255000,259000,And -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy.,2HgL5OFip-0
259000,264000,"And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program,",2HgL5OFip-0
264000,266000,and he talked about DNA.,2HgL5OFip-0
266000,269000,"And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist,",2HgL5OFip-0
269000,273000,"and after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA",2HgL5OFip-0
273000,276000,because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute,2HgL5OFip-0
276000,280000,to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.,2HgL5OFip-0
280000,281000,Most people believed it was proteins.,2HgL5OFip-0
281000,285000,"But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet,",2HgL5OFip-0
285000,289000,and he showed this x-ray photograph.,2HgL5OFip-0
289000,293000,"Sort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure,",2HgL5OFip-0
293000,296000,even though it owed it to probably different molecules,2HgL5OFip-0
296000,298000,carrying different sets of instructions.,2HgL5OFip-0
298000,300000,So there was something universal about the DNA molecule.,2HgL5OFip-0
300000,305000,"So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher,",2HgL5OFip-0
305000,306000,"and I ended up in Cambridge, England.",2HgL5OFip-0
306000,308000,"So I went to Cambridge,",2HgL5OFip-0
308000,311000,because it was really the best place in the world then,2HgL5OFip-0
311000,315000,for x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject,2HgL5OFip-0
315000,317000,"in, you know, chemistry departments.",2HgL5OFip-0
317000,320000,"I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.",2HgL5OFip-0
320000,324000,So the best place for x-ray crystallography,2HgL5OFip-0
324000,327000,was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.,2HgL5OFip-0
327000,333000,And there I met Francis Crick.,2HgL5OFip-0
333000,336000,I went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23.,2HgL5OFip-0
336000,341000,"And within a day, we had decided that",2HgL5OFip-0
341000,346000,maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.,2HgL5OFip-0
346000,352000,"Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model,",2HgL5OFip-0
352000,356000,"an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know,",2HgL5OFip-0
356000,359000,"length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.",2HgL5OFip-0
359000,362000,But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up?,2HgL5OFip-0
362000,366000,"And the reason for doing so, at the center of this photograph,",2HgL5OFip-0
366000,369000,"is Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed",2HgL5OFip-0
369000,373000,"the alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so,",2HgL5OFip-0
373000,375000,"he banished the man out on the right,",2HgL5OFip-0
375000,378000,"Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.",2HgL5OFip-0
378000,380000,"This is a photograph several years later,",2HgL5OFip-0
380000,382000,when Bragg had cause to smile.,2HgL5OFip-0
382000,384000,"He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there,",2HgL5OFip-0
384000,388000,"because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix,",2HgL5OFip-0
388000,392000,and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists.,2HgL5OFip-0
392000,397000,"And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists,",2HgL5OFip-0
397000,403000,"so we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins.",2HgL5OFip-0
403000,405000,So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.,2HgL5OFip-0
405000,408000,"X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.",2HgL5OFip-0
408000,410000,So we built a three-stranded model.,2HgL5OFip-0
410000,412000,The people from London came up.,2HgL5OFip-0
412000,417000,"Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator,",2HgL5OFip-0
417000,420000,"Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.",2HgL5OFip-0
420000,422000,"They said it was lousy, and it was.",2HgL5OFip-0
422000,427000,So we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent.,2HgL5OFip-0
427000,431000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
431000,433000,"And so we didn't build any models,",2HgL5OFip-0
433000,436000,and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.,2HgL5OFip-0
436000,442000,"And basically, I did nothing. And -- except read.",2HgL5OFip-0
442000,445000,"You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.",2HgL5OFip-0
445000,448000,And we kept telling the people in London,2HgL5OFip-0
448000,450000,that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA.,2HgL5OFip-0
450000,452000,"If DNA is that important, Linus will know it.",2HgL5OFip-0
452000,454000,"He'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.",2HgL5OFip-0
454000,456000,"And, in fact, he'd written the people in London:",2HgL5OFip-0
456000,459000,Could he see their x-ray photograph?,2HgL5OFip-0
459000,462000,"And they had the wisdom to say no."" So he didn't have it.""",2HgL5OFip-0
462000,464000,But there was ones in the literature.,2HgL5OFip-0
464000,466000,"Actually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully.",2HgL5OFip-0
466000,472000,"But about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge,",2HgL5OFip-0
472000,475000,"a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son,",2HgL5OFip-0
475000,479000,"who was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA.",2HgL5OFip-0
479000,483000,"And so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling,",2HgL5OFip-0
483000,485000,and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts.,2HgL5OFip-0
485000,491000,"And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.",2HgL5OFip-0
491000,494000,"I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.",2HgL5OFip-0
494000,496000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
496000,502000,"And so there was the paper, and he proposed a three-stranded structure.",2HgL5OFip-0
502000,504000,"And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.",2HgL5OFip-0
504000,509000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
509000,512000,"So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's --",2HgL5OFip-0
512000,514000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
514000,517000,"-- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds",2HgL5OFip-0
517000,519000,between phosphate groups.,2HgL5OFip-0
519000,523000,"Well, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven,",2HgL5OFip-0
523000,526000,those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist.,2HgL5OFip-0
526000,528000,"We rushed over to the chemistry department and said,",2HgL5OFip-0
528000,534000,"Could Pauling be right?"" And Alex Hust said, ""No."" So we were happy.""",2HgL5OFip-0
534000,536000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
536000,539000,"And, you know, we were still in the game, but we were frightened",2HgL5OFip-0
539000,543000,that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong.,2HgL5OFip-0
543000,545000,"And so Bragg said, Build models.""""",2HgL5OFip-0
545000,549000,And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript --,2HgL5OFip-0
549000,554000,"I should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people.",2HgL5OFip-0
554000,557000,"Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game",2HgL5OFip-0
557000,559000,and that they should immediately start building models.,2HgL5OFip-0
559000,564000,"But Wilkins said no."" Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months,""",2HgL5OFip-0
564000,567000,and after she left he would start building models.,2HgL5OFip-0
567000,571000,"And so I came back with that news to Cambridge,",2HgL5OFip-0
571000,572000,"and Bragg said, Build models.""""",2HgL5OFip-0
572000,573000,"Well, of course, I wanted to build models.",2HgL5OFip-0
573000,579000,"And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know,",2HgL5OFip-0
579000,581000,"in one sense she was a chemist,",2HgL5OFip-0
581000,583000,but really she would have been trained --,2HgL5OFip-0
583000,586000,she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry.,2HgL5OFip-0
586000,587000,She was a crystallographer.,2HgL5OFip-0
587000,592000,And I think part of the reason she didn't want to build models,2HgL5OFip-0
592000,595000,"was, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist.",2HgL5OFip-0
595000,600000,"And so Crick and I, you know, started building models,",2HgL5OFip-0
600000,603000,"and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough.",2HgL5OFip-0
603000,607000,"Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.",2HgL5OFip-0
607000,611000,"And it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule:",2HgL5OFip-0
611000,617000,"Never be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't.",2HgL5OFip-0
617000,619000,We weren't the best chemists in the room.,2HgL5OFip-0
619000,621000,"I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done,",2HgL5OFip-0
621000,625000,"and Jerry Donohue -- he was a chemist -- he said, it's wrong.",2HgL5OFip-0
625000,628000,You've got -- the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.,2HgL5OFip-0
628000,631000,I just put them down like they were in the books.,2HgL5OFip-0
631000,632000,He said they were wrong.,2HgL5OFip-0
632000,636000,"So the next day, you know, after I thought, Well, he might be right.""""",2HgL5OFip-0
636000,640000,"So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing,",2HgL5OFip-0
640000,643000,and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.,2HgL5OFip-0
643000,645000,And we knew we were right.,2HgL5OFip-0
645000,652000,"So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.",2HgL5OFip-0
652000,656000,From nothing to thing.,2HgL5OFip-0
656000,661000,"And we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T",2HgL5OFip-0
661000,664000,"and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism.",2HgL5OFip-0
664000,668000,So we saw how genetic information is carried.,2HgL5OFip-0
668000,669000,It's the order of the four bases.,2HgL5OFip-0
669000,673000,"So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.",2HgL5OFip-0
673000,678000,And you copy it by going from strand-separating.,2HgL5OFip-0
678000,686000,"So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it,",2HgL5OFip-0
686000,687000,because you didn't have any other scheme.,2HgL5OFip-0
687000,690000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
690000,693000,But that's not the way most scientists think.,2HgL5OFip-0
693000,696000,Most scientists are really rather dull.,2HgL5OFip-0
696000,698000,"They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.",2HgL5OFip-0
698000,704000,"But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.",2HgL5OFip-0
704000,708000,"So think about it. The next five years,",2HgL5OFip-0
708000,710000,there were essentially something like five references,2HgL5OFip-0
710000,712000,"to our work in Nature"" -- none.""",2HgL5OFip-0
713000,715000,"And so we were left by ourselves,",2HgL5OFip-0
715000,720000,and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you --,2HgL5OFip-0
720000,724000,what does this genetic information do?,2HgL5OFip-0
724000,728000,It was pretty obvious that it provided the information,2HgL5OFip-0
728000,731000,"to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?",2HgL5OFip-0
731000,736000,For about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA.,2HgL5OFip-0
736000,739000,It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs.,2HgL5OFip-0
739000,742000,I was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me.,2HgL5OFip-0
742000,745000,"It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.",2HgL5OFip-0
745000,748000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
748000,752000,"So there's a picture of Francis and I before I met the girl,",2HgL5OFip-0
752000,753000,so I'm still looking happy.,2HgL5OFip-0
753000,756000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
756000,759000,But there is what we did when we didn't know,2HgL5OFip-0
759000,765000,where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.,2HgL5OFip-0
765000,769000,"George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.",2HgL5OFip-0
769000,772000,He was one of the members. The question was:,2HgL5OFip-0
772000,774000,How do you go from a four-letter code,2HgL5OFip-0
774000,776000,to the 20-letter code of proteins?,2HgL5OFip-0

781000,787000,"But that's the only -- no, we were only photographed twice.",2HgL5OFip-0
787000,790000,"And on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.",2HgL5OFip-0
790000,793000,"There's Francis up on the upper right,",2HgL5OFip-0
793000,798000,and Alex Rich -- the M.D.-turned-crystallographer -- is next to me.,2HgL5OFip-0
798000,802000,This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955.,2HgL5OFip-0
802000,808000,"And I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think,",2HgL5OFip-0
808000,811000,"because the girl I had, boy, she was gone.",2HgL5OFip-0
811000,815000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
815000,820000,"And so I didn't really get happy until 1960,",2HgL5OFip-0
820000,824000,"because then we found out, basically, you know,",2HgL5OFip-0
824000,826000,that there are three forms of RNA.,2HgL5OFip-0
826000,829000,"And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.",2HgL5OFip-0
829000,831000,RNA provides the information for protein.,2HgL5OFip-0
831000,836000,"And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA --",2HgL5OFip-0
836000,842000,"put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine,",2HgL5OFip-0
842000,850000,"polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code,",2HgL5OFip-0
850000,852000,and it was all over by 1966.,2HgL5OFip-0
852000,855000,"So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was --",2HgL5OFip-0
855000,859000,so what happened since then?,2HgL5OFip-0
859000,862000,"Well, at that time -- I should go back.",2HgL5OFip-0
862000,867000,"When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk",2HgL5OFip-0
867000,870000,"at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard,",2HgL5OFip-0
870000,873000,"he looked at me and said, Are you going to patent this?""""",2HgL5OFip-0
873000,878000,"And -- but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it,",2HgL5OFip-0
878000,880000,because you couldn't. No use for it.,2HgL5OFip-0
880000,882000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
882000,886000,"And so DNA didn't become a useful molecule,",2HgL5OFip-0
886000,891000,"and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973,",2HgL5OFip-0
891000,896000,"20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco",2HgL5OFip-0
896000,898000,"and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA,",2HgL5OFip-0
898000,901000,and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money.,2HgL5OFip-0
901000,902000,At least they patented something,2HgL5OFip-0
902000,905000,"which, you know, could do useful things.",2HgL5OFip-0
905000,908000,"And then, they learned how to read the letters for the code.",2HgL5OFip-0
908000,913000,"And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And,",2HgL5OFip-0
913000,920000,"but we were still a long ways from, you know,",2HgL5OFip-0
920000,922000,"answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood,",2HgL5OFip-0
922000,927000,which is: How do you nature-nurture?,2HgL5OFip-0
927000,931000,"And so I'll go on. I'm already out of time,",2HgL5OFip-0
931000,934000,"but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician",2HgL5OFip-0
934000,937000,turned physicist. And he developed a technique,2HgL5OFip-0
937000,941000,which essentially will let us look at sample DNA,2HgL5OFip-0
941000,943000,"and, eventually, a million spots along it.",2HgL5OFip-0
943000,946000,"There's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one",2HgL5OFip-0
946000,949000,made by a photolithography by a company in Madison,2HgL5OFip-0
949000,954000,"called NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix.",2HgL5OFip-0
954000,956000,And we use their technique.,2HgL5OFip-0
956000,961000,And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.,2HgL5OFip-0
961000,965000,And you can see on the top,2HgL5OFip-0
965000,970000,that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.,2HgL5OFip-0
970000,973000,"So the DNA is really badly mucked up,",2HgL5OFip-0
973000,975000,"whereas if you have a chance of surviving,",2HgL5OFip-0
975000,977000,the DNA isn't so mucked up.,2HgL5OFip-0
977000,980000,So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call,2HgL5OFip-0
980000,984000,"DNA biopsies."" Before you get treated for cancer,""",2HgL5OFip-0
984000,986000,"you should really look at this technique,",2HgL5OFip-0
986000,989000,and get a feeling of the face of the enemy.,2HgL5OFip-0
989000,992000,"It's not a -- it's only a partial look, but it's a --",2HgL5OFip-0
992000,995000,"I think it's going to be very, very useful.",2HgL5OFip-0
995000,997000,"So, we started with breast cancer",2HgL5OFip-0
997000,1000000,"because there's lots of money for it, no government money.",2HgL5OFip-0
1000000,1004000,And now I have a sort of vested interest:,2HgL5OFip-0
1004000,1006000,"I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know,",2HgL5OFip-0
1006000,1009000,you aren't treated if it's not dangerous.,2HgL5OFip-0
1009000,1015000,"But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells,",2HgL5OFip-0
1015000,1018000,and made a really sort of surprising observation.,2HgL5OFip-0
1018000,1022000,"Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome",2HgL5OFip-0
1022000,1024000,where we've lost a gene or gained another one.,2HgL5OFip-0
1025000,1031000,"So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well,",2HgL5OFip-0
1031000,1033000,"if we're around here, you know,",2HgL5OFip-0
1033000,1036000,these little losses or gains might not be too bad.,2HgL5OFip-0
1036000,1041000,"But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene,",2HgL5OFip-0
1041000,1042000,maybe we'll feel sick.,2HgL5OFip-0
1042000,1046000,So the first disease he looked at is autism.,2HgL5OFip-0
1046000,1051000,And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.,2HgL5OFip-0
1051000,1056000,"Looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child",2HgL5OFip-0
1056000,1058000,"with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism,",2HgL5OFip-0
1058000,1063000,had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it.,2HgL5OFip-0
1063000,1066000,"Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it",2HgL5OFip-0
1066000,1069000,we began to find genes for autism.,2HgL5OFip-0
1069000,1073000,"And you can see here, there are a lot of them.",2HgL5OFip-0
1073000,1077000,So a lot of autistic kids are autistic,2HgL5OFip-0
1077000,1079000,because they just lost a big piece of DNA.,2HgL5OFip-0
1079000,1081000,"I mean, big piece at the molecular level.",2HgL5OFip-0
1081000,1083000,"We saw one autistic kid,",2HgL5OFip-0
1083000,1086000,about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.,2HgL5OFip-0
1086000,1089000,"We haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably",2HgL5OFip-0
1089000,1092000,"don't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents.",2HgL5OFip-0
1092000,1099000,"Now, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars.",2HgL5OFip-0
1099000,1103000,I think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position,2HgL5OFip-0
1103000,1106000,"to help parents who've had an autistic child,",2HgL5OFip-0
1106000,1108000,"or think they may have an autistic child,",2HgL5OFip-0
1108000,1110000,and can we spot the difference?,2HgL5OFip-0
1110000,1113000,So this same technique should probably look at all.,2HgL5OFip-0
1113000,1117000,It's a wonderful way to find genes.,2HgL5OFip-0
1117000,1119000,"And so, I'll conclude by saying",2HgL5OFip-0
1119000,1121000,we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.,2HgL5OFip-0
1121000,1125000,And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred,2HgL5OFip-0
1125000,1127000,"before we got the picture. But as you can see,",2HgL5OFip-0
1127000,1131000,there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.,2HgL5OFip-0
1131000,1134000,"And yet, in the controls there were three.",2HgL5OFip-0
1134000,1136000,So what's the meaning of the controls?,2HgL5OFip-0
1136000,1138000,"Were they crazy also, and we didn't know it?",2HgL5OFip-0
1138000,1142000,"Or, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal.",2HgL5OFip-0
1142000,1149000,"And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure,",2HgL5OFip-0
1149000,1155000,and whether this is one that predisposes --,2HgL5OFip-0
1155000,1159000,and then there's only a sub-segment of the population,2HgL5OFip-0
1159000,1161000,that's capable of being schizophrenic.,2HgL5OFip-0
1161000,1165000,"Now, we don't have really any evidence of it,",2HgL5OFip-0
1165000,1170000,"but I think, to give you a hypothesis, the best guess",2HgL5OFip-0
1170000,1176000,"is that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia.",2HgL5OFip-0
1176000,1179000,"30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed,",2HgL5OFip-0
1179000,1182000,"and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics,",2HgL5OFip-0
1182000,1186000,"which means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed,",2HgL5OFip-0
1186000,1189000,but only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say.,2HgL5OFip-0
1189000,1192000,"Now, some people who think they're right-handed",2HgL5OFip-0
1192000,1198000,"are genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think,",2HgL5OFip-0
1198000,1202000,"oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know,",2HgL5OFip-0
1202000,1205000,children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK?,2HgL5OFip-0
1205000,1208000,(Laughter),2HgL5OFip-0
1208000,1211000,"So it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time.",2HgL5OFip-0
1211000,1213000,We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar;,2HgL5OFip-0
1213000,1214000,there's a relationship.,2HgL5OFip-0
1214000,1218000,"And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.",2HgL5OFip-0

prevented more infections.",6Af6b_wyiwI

425434,428609,you had a situation where — I'll try and draw the tap,EjSuaeVfE9I

440945,444066,"I mean, this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me?",EjSuaeVfE9I
444066,448184,So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great.,EjSuaeVfE9I
448184,451896,"And he says, Anything you notice?"" No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe,""",EjSuaeVfE9I

454072,457393,the container up with green ink. You with me?,EjSuaeVfE9I
457393,461183,So guess what happens? A thin green line comes out,EjSuaeVfE9I
461183,465529,as it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting.,EjSuaeVfE9I

469821,473007,"So he's changing the flow of the water, but it's just a boring green line.",EjSuaeVfE9I

481030,484005,"the whole of that green line disappears, and instead",EjSuaeVfE9I
484005,487365,there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle.,EjSuaeVfE9I
487365,490529,They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink,EjSuaeVfE9I

494213,498226,What's happened in this world of pipe,EjSuaeVfE9I
498226,502153,is somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent.,EjSuaeVfE9I

505834,509953,"all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available,",EjSuaeVfE9I

517753,521050,"And I think this is our challenge, because somebody",EjSuaeVfE9I
521050,525154,has actually increased — and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff —,EjSuaeVfE9I
525154,529135,"the speed, the scale and the density of interaction.",EjSuaeVfE9I
529135,530834,Now how do we cope and deal with that?,EjSuaeVfE9I
530834,534267,"Well, we could just call it turbulence, or we could try and learn.",EjSuaeVfE9I
534267,539365,"Yes, learn, but I know you guys grew up in the days when",EjSuaeVfE9I
539365,542169,"there were actually these things called correct answers,",EjSuaeVfE9I

545330,547143,and you believe it will last forever.,EjSuaeVfE9I
547143,550570,"So I'll put a little line up here which represents learning,",EjSuaeVfE9I

552745,555258,"understand them, take the time to put them into practice.",EjSuaeVfE9I
555258,559107,"Out here is the world. Now, what's happened to our pace",EjSuaeVfE9I
559107,562352,"of learning as the world has accelerated? Well, if you work",EjSuaeVfE9I
562352,564898,"for a corporation, you'll discover it's quite difficult to work",EjSuaeVfE9I
564898,567844,"on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of, isn't in the strategy,",EjSuaeVfE9I

570449,575817,"If you work in an institution, one day you will get them to make that decision.",EjSuaeVfE9I
575817,578552,"And if you work in a market where people believe in cycles,",EjSuaeVfE9I
578552,580939,"it's even funnier, because you have to wait all the way",EjSuaeVfE9I
580939,584562,"for the cycle to fail before you go, There's something wrong."" You with me?""",EjSuaeVfE9I
584562,590114,"So it's likely that the line, in terms of learning, is pretty flat.",EjSuaeVfE9I

594311,598214,"the lines cross over, the pace of change",EjSuaeVfE9I

206260,208260,"and through a bit of a leap of logic,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
208260,210260,decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
210260,212260,(Laughter),dXqPaHQp4Xw
212260,214260,"The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
214260,217260,"it's about 3,000 miles,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
217260,219260,and it turned out to be,dXqPaHQp4Xw
219260,222260,the hardest thing I had ever done.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
222260,225260,"Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
225260,227260,but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that,dXqPaHQp4Xw
227260,229260,"getting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
229260,231260,extremely uncomfortable.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
233260,235260,And my timing was not great either:,dXqPaHQp4Xw
235260,237260,"2005, when I did the Atlantic,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
237260,239260,was the year of Hurricane Katrina.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
239260,242260,There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic,dXqPaHQp4Xw
242260,245260,"than ever before, since records began.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
245260,247260,"And pretty early on,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
247260,250260,those storms started making their presence known.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
251260,253260,All four of my oars broke,dXqPaHQp4Xw
253260,255260,before I reached halfway across.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
255260,258260,Oars are not supposed to look like this.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
258260,260260,But what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
260260,262260,Oars are your only means of propulsion.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
262260,264260,So I just had to look around the boat,dXqPaHQp4Xw
264260,266260,and figure out what I was going to use,dXqPaHQp4Xw
266260,268260,to fix up these oars so that I could carry on.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
268260,271260,So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape,dXqPaHQp4Xw
271260,273260,and splintered the boat hook,dXqPaHQp4Xw
273260,276260,to the oars to reinforce it.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
276260,278260,"Then, when that gave out,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
278260,281260,I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat,dXqPaHQp4Xw
281260,283260,and used those.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
283260,286260,"And then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
286260,288260,I'd never been very good at fixing stuff,dXqPaHQp4Xw
288260,290260,"when I was living my old life,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
290260,293260,but it's amazing how resourceful you can become,dXqPaHQp4Xw
293260,295260,when you're in the middle of the ocean,dXqPaHQp4Xw
295260,297260,and there's only one way to get to the other side.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
297260,299260,And the oars kind of became a symbol,dXqPaHQp4Xw
299260,302260,of just in how many ways,dXqPaHQp4Xw
302260,304260,I went beyond what I thought were my limits.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
304260,307260,I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders,dXqPaHQp4Xw
307260,309260,and saltwater sores on my bottom.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
309260,312260,"I really struggled psychologically,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
312260,315260,"totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
315260,318260,"realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
318260,320260,"3,000 miles was going to",dXqPaHQp4Xw
320260,322260,"take me a very, very long time.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
322260,324260,There were so many times,dXqPaHQp4Xw
324260,326260,"when I thought I'd hit that limit,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
326260,329260,but had no choice but to just carry on,dXqPaHQp4Xw
329260,331260,and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side,dXqPaHQp4Xw
331260,333260,without driving myself crazy.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
333260,335260,And eventually after,dXqPaHQp4Xw
335260,337260,"103 days at sea,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
337260,339260,I arrived in Antigua.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
339260,341260,I don't think I've ever felt so happy,dXqPaHQp4Xw
341260,343260,in my entire life.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
343260,345260,It was a bit like finishing a marathon,dXqPaHQp4Xw
345260,347260,and getting out of solitary confinement,dXqPaHQp4Xw
347260,350260,and winning an Oscar all rolled into one.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
350260,352260,I was euphoric.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
352260,354260,And to see all the people coming out to greet me,dXqPaHQp4Xw
354260,357260,"and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
357260,359260,I just felt like a movie star.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
359260,361260,It was absolutely wonderful.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
361260,363260,"And I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
363260,365260,the bigger the sense of achievement,dXqPaHQp4Xw
365260,367260,when you get to the end of it.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
368260,371260,So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out,dXqPaHQp4Xw
371260,374260,to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing,dXqPaHQp4Xw
374260,376260,that might be going through your mind.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
376260,379260,Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?,dXqPaHQp4Xw
379260,382260,"A few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eat",dXqPaHQp4Xw
382260,385260,much more unprocessed foods.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
385260,387260,So I grow my own beansprouts.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
387260,389260,"I eat fruits and nut bars,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
389260,391260,a lot of nuts.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
391260,393260,And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter,dXqPaHQp4Xw
393260,395260,at the other end.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
395260,397260,Question number two: How do you sleep?,dXqPaHQp4Xw
397260,400260,With my eyes shut. Ha-ha.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
400260,402260,I suppose what you mean is:,dXqPaHQp4Xw
402260,404260,What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?,dXqPaHQp4Xw
404260,406260,"Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting",dXqPaHQp4Xw
406260,408260,with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
408260,410260,"On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles",dXqPaHQp4Xw
410260,412260,in the right direction.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
412260,415260,"Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
415260,417260,That's a bad day at the office.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
417260,419260,What do I wear?,dXqPaHQp4Xw
419260,421260,"Mostly, a baseball cap,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
421260,424260,"rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
424260,427260,depending on whether I went backwards overnight --,dXqPaHQp4Xw
427260,429260,and lots of sun lotion.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
429260,431260,Do I have a chase boat?,dXqPaHQp4Xw
431260,434260,No I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
434260,436260,I don't see anybody for the whole time,dXqPaHQp4Xw
436260,438260,"that I'm at sea, generally.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
440260,443260,And finally: Am I crazy?,dXqPaHQp4Xw
443260,446260,"Well, I leave that one up to you to judge.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
446260,449260,"So, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?",dXqPaHQp4Xw
449260,452260,"Well, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
453260,455260,"Well, I thought the Atlantic was big,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
455260,458260,"but the Pacific is really, really big.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
460260,463260,I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
463260,465260,I don't know for sure that the Brits,dXqPaHQp4Xw
465260,468260,"invented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so:",dXqPaHQp4Xw
468260,470260,"we are right in the middle,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
470260,472260,and we've cut the Pacific in half,dXqPaHQp4Xw
472260,475260,and flung it to the far corners of the world.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
475260,478260,"Whereas if you look in Google Earth,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
478260,480260,this is how the Pacific looks.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
480260,483260,It pretty much covers half the planet.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
483260,485260,You can just see a little bit of North America up here,dXqPaHQp4Xw
485260,488260,and a sliver of Australia down there.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
488260,490260,It is really big --,dXqPaHQp4Xw
490260,492260,65 million square miles --,dXqPaHQp4Xw
492260,494260,and to row in a straight line across it,dXqPaHQp4Xw
494260,496260,"would be about 8,000 miles.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
496260,498260,"Unfortunately, ocean rowboats",dXqPaHQp4Xw
498260,500260,very rarely go in a straight line.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
500260,502260,"By the time I get to Australia,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
502260,504260,"if I get to Australia,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
504260,507260,"I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
509260,511260,"So, because nobody in their straight mind would row",dXqPaHQp4Xw
511260,513260,"straight past Hawaii without dropping in,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
513260,515260,I decided to cut this very big undertaking,dXqPaHQp4Xw
515260,518260,into three segments.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
518260,520260,The first attempt didn't go so well.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
520260,523260,"In 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drill",dXqPaHQp4Xw
523260,525260,three times in 24 hours.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
525260,527260,A bit like being in a washing machine.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
527260,529260,"Boat got a bit dinged up,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
529260,531260,so did I.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
531260,533260,"I blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebody",dXqPaHQp4Xw
533260,535260,with a bit of a hero complex decided that,dXqPaHQp4Xw
535260,538260,this damsel was in distress and needed saving.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
538260,541260,The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
541260,543260,I tried to tell them to go away.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
543260,545260,We had a bit of a battle of wills.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
545260,547260,I lost and got airlifted.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
547260,549260,"Awful, really awful.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
549260,551260,"It was one of the worst feelings of my life,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
551260,554260,as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter,dXqPaHQp4Xw
554260,556260,and looked down at my trusty little boat,dXqPaHQp4Xw
556260,559260,rolling around in the 20 foot waves,dXqPaHQp4Xw
559260,561260,and wondering if I would ever see her again.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
561260,563260,So I had to launch a very expensive,dXqPaHQp4Xw
563260,565260,salvage operation,dXqPaHQp4Xw
565260,567260,and then wait another nine months,dXqPaHQp4Xw
567260,569260,before I could get back out onto the ocean again.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
569260,571260,But what do you do?,dXqPaHQp4Xw
571260,573260,"Fall down nine times, get up 10.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
573260,575260,"So, the following year, I set out",dXqPaHQp4Xw
575260,578260,"and, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
578260,580260,But it was not without misadventure.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
580260,582260,"My watermaker broke,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
582260,585260,only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
585260,587260,"Powered by my solar panels,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
587260,589260,it sucks in saltwater,dXqPaHQp4Xw
589260,591260,and turns it into freshwater.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
591260,594260,"But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
594260,596260,which is what happened to it.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
596260,598260,"Fortunately, help was at hand.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
598260,600260,There was another unusual boat out there,dXqPaHQp4Xw
600260,603260,"at the same time, doing as I was doing,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
603260,606260,"bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
606260,609260,"that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
609260,611260,with an estimated 3.5 million,dXqPaHQp4Xw
611260,613260,"tons of trash in it,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
613260,615260,circulating at the center of,dXqPaHQp4Xw
615260,617260,that North Pacific Gyre.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
617260,619260,"So, to make the point, these guys",dXqPaHQp4Xw
619260,622260,"had actually built their boat out of plastic trash,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
622260,624260,"15,000 empty water bottles",dXqPaHQp4Xw
624260,627260,latched together into two pontoons.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
627260,629260,They were going very slowly.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
629260,631260,"Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
631260,634260,They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach,dXqPaHQp4Xw
634260,637260,"because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
637260,639260,and they were starting to sink.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
639260,642260,So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
644260,647260,"But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
647260,649260,"luckily, our courses were converging.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
649260,652260,They were running out of food; I was running out of water.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
652260,655260,So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
655260,657260,And it took about a week,dXqPaHQp4Xw
657260,659260,for us to actually gradually converge.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
659260,661260,I was doing a pathetically slow speed,dXqPaHQp4Xw
661260,663260,"of about 1.3 knots,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
663260,666260,and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:,dXqPaHQp4Xw
666260,669260,it was like two snails in a mating dance.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
669260,671260,"But, eventually, we did manage to meet up",dXqPaHQp4Xw
671260,673260,"and Joel hopped overboard,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
673260,675260,"caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
675260,677260,which was the best food I'd had,dXqPaHQp4Xw
677260,679260,"in, ooh, at least three months.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
679260,681260,"Fortunately, the one that he caught that day",dXqPaHQp4Xw
681260,684260,was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
684260,686260,"When they opened this one up,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
686260,688260,they found its stomach was full of plastic.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
688260,690260,And this is really bad news because plastic,dXqPaHQp4Xw
690260,692260,is not an inert substance.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
692260,694260,It leaches out chemicals,dXqPaHQp4Xw
694260,696260,"into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
696260,699260,"and then we come along and eat that poor critter,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
699260,701260,and we get some of the toxins accumulating,dXqPaHQp4Xw
701260,703260,in our bodies as well.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
703260,706260,So there are very real implications for human health.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
707260,710260,I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
710260,712260,"And, the following year, set out",dXqPaHQp4Xw
712260,715260,"on the second stage of the Pacific,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
715260,718260,from Hawaii down to Tarawa.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
718260,721260,And you'll notice something about Tarawa;,dXqPaHQp4Xw
721260,723260,it is very low-lying.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
723260,726260,"It's that little green sliver on the horizon,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
726260,728260,which makes them very nervous,dXqPaHQp4Xw
728260,730260,about rising oceans.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
730260,732260,This is big trouble for these guys.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
732260,735260,They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
735260,737260,"And also, as an increase in extreme",dXqPaHQp4Xw
737260,739260,"weather events due to climate change,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
739260,741260,they're expecting more waves,dXqPaHQp4Xw
741260,744260,"to come in over the fringing reef,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
744260,747260,which will contaminate their fresh water supply.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
747260,749260,"I had a meeting with the president there,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
749260,751260,who told me about his,dXqPaHQp4Xw
751260,753260,exit strategy for his country.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
753260,755260,"He expects that within the next 50 years,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
755260,757260,"the 100,000 people that live there",dXqPaHQp4Xw
757260,759260,will have to relocate to,dXqPaHQp4Xw
759260,761260,New Zealand or Australia.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
761260,763260,And that made me think about how would I feel,dXqPaHQp4Xw
763260,766260,if Britain was going to disappear under the waves;,dXqPaHQp4Xw
766260,768260,if the places where I'd been born,dXqPaHQp4Xw
768260,770260,and gone to school,dXqPaHQp4Xw
770260,772260,"and got married,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
772260,774260,if all those places were just going to disappear forever.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
774260,776260,"How, literally, ungrounded",dXqPaHQp4Xw
776260,778260,that would make me feel.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
780260,783260,"Very shortly, I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
783260,786260,"and if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row solo",dXqPaHQp4Xw
786260,788260,all the way across the Pacific.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
788260,791260,"And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
791260,794260,to bring a human face to the ocean.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
794260,797260,"If the Atlantic was about my inner journey,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
797260,799260,"discovering my own capabilities,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
799260,802260,"maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
802260,804260,figuring out how I can use,dXqPaHQp4Xw
804260,806260,my interesting career choice,dXqPaHQp4Xw
806260,809260,"to be of service to the world,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
809260,812260,and to take some of those things that I've learned out there,dXqPaHQp4Xw
812260,814260,and apply them to the situation,dXqPaHQp4Xw
814260,817260,that humankind now finds itself in.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
817260,820260,I think there are probably three key points here.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
820260,822260,The first one is about,dXqPaHQp4Xw
822260,824260,the stories that we tell ourselves.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
824260,826260,"For so long, I told myself",dXqPaHQp4Xw
826260,828260,that I couldn't have an adventure,dXqPaHQp4Xw
828260,830260,because I wasn't six foot tall,dXqPaHQp4Xw
830260,833260,and athletic and bearded.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
833260,836260,And then that story changed.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
836260,839260,I found out that people had rowed across oceans.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
839260,842260,I even met one of them and she was just about my size.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
842260,844260,"So even though I didn't grow any taller,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
844260,846260,"I didn't sprout a beard,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
846260,849260,something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
849260,852260,"At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves",dXqPaHQp4Xw
852260,854260,"is that we need all this stuff,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
854260,856260,that we need oil.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
856260,859260,But what about if we just change that story?,dXqPaHQp4Xw
859260,861260,"We do have alternatives,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
861260,863260,and we have the power of free will,dXqPaHQp4Xw
863260,866260,"to choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
866260,868260,to create a greener future.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
870260,872260,The second point is about,dXqPaHQp4Xw
872260,874260,the accumulation of tiny actions.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
875260,878260,We might think that anything that we do as an individual,dXqPaHQp4Xw
878260,881260,"is just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
881260,883260,"But it does. Generally, we haven't",dXqPaHQp4Xw
883260,886260,got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
886260,888260,"Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes",dXqPaHQp4Xw
888260,890260,"and the Chernobyls,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
890260,892260,but mostly it's been an accumulation,dXqPaHQp4Xw
892260,894260,of bad decisions,dXqPaHQp4Xw
894260,896260,"by billions of individuals,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
896260,899260,day after day and year after year.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
899260,901260,"And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
901260,903260,"We can start making better,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
903260,906260,"wiser, more sustainable decisions.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
906260,908260,"And when we do that, we're not just one person.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
908260,911260,Anything that we do spreads ripples.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
911260,913260,Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line,dXqPaHQp4Xw
913260,915260,and you pull out your,dXqPaHQp4Xw
915260,917260,reusable grocery bag.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
917260,919260,"Maybe if we all start doing this,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
919260,921260,we can make it socially unacceptable,dXqPaHQp4Xw
921260,924260,to say yes to plastic in the checkout line.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
924260,926260,That's just one example.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
926260,928260,This is a world-wide community.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
929260,931260,The other point:,dXqPaHQp4Xw
931260,933260,It's about taking responsibility.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
933260,935260,"For so much of my life,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
935260,938260,I wanted something else to make me happy.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
938260,940260,I thought if I had the right house or the right car,dXqPaHQp4Xw
940260,942260,"or the right man in my life,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
942260,944260,then I could be happy.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
944260,947260,"But when I wrote that obituary exercise,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
947260,950260,I actually grew up a little bit in that moment,dXqPaHQp4Xw
950260,953260,and realized that I needed to create my own future.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
953260,955260,I couldn't just wait passively,dXqPaHQp4Xw
955260,958260,for happiness to come and find me.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
958260,960260,And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
960260,962260,"I plan on being around for a long time,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
962260,964260,"and when I'm 90 years old,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
964260,966260,I want to be happy and healthy.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
966260,968260,And it's very difficult to be happy,dXqPaHQp4Xw
968260,970260,on a planet that's racked,dXqPaHQp4Xw
970260,973260,with famine and drought.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
973260,975260,It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet,dXqPaHQp4Xw
975260,978260,where we've poisoned the earth,dXqPaHQp4Xw
978260,981260,and the sea and the air.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
981260,983260,"So, shortly, I'm going to be",dXqPaHQp4Xw
983260,985260,launching a new initiative,dXqPaHQp4Xw
985260,988260,called Eco-Heroes.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
988260,990260,And the idea here is that,dXqPaHQp4Xw
990260,993260,all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
993260,995260,It's meant to be a bit of a game.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
995260,997260,We're going to make an iPhone app out of it.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
997260,999260,We just want to try and create that awareness,dXqPaHQp4Xw
999260,1002260,"because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
1002260,1004260,"but that attitude,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
1004260,1007260,that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb,dXqPaHQp4Xw
1007260,1009260,"or take your reusable coffee mug,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
1009260,1012260,that is what could change the world.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
1012260,1014260,I really believe that we stand,dXqPaHQp4Xw
1014260,1017260,at a very important point in history.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
1017260,1019260,"We have a choice. We've been blessed,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
1019260,1021260,"or cursed, with free will.",dXqPaHQp4Xw
1021260,1024260,"We can choose a greener future,",dXqPaHQp4Xw
1024260,1026260,and we can get there,dXqPaHQp4Xw
1026260,1029260,if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
1029260,1031260,Thank you.,dXqPaHQp4Xw
1031260,1034260,(Applause),dXqPaHQp4Xw
15260,17260,Today I'm going to talk,nw52e0dfCaA
17260,19260,about unexpected discoveries.,nw52e0dfCaA
19260,23260,Now I work in the solar technology industry.,nw52e0dfCaA
23260,26260,And my small startup,nw52e0dfCaA

12527,15372,Anyone in the room thought about sex today?,N39x_WTPix0

16532,17737,"Yeah, you did.",N39x_WTPix0
17737,20203,Thank you for putting your hand up over there.,N39x_WTPix0
20203,21923,"Well, I'm here to provide you with",N39x_WTPix0
21923,23618,some biological validation,N39x_WTPix0
23618,25048,for your sordid daydreams.,N39x_WTPix0
25048,26442,I'm here to tell you a few things,N39x_WTPix0
26442,29948,that you might not have known about wild sex.,N39x_WTPix0
29948,31796,"Now, when humans think about sex,",N39x_WTPix0
31796,33526,male and female forms,N39x_WTPix0
33526,35197,"are generally what come to mind,",N39x_WTPix0
35197,37650,"but for many millions of years,",N39x_WTPix0
37650,40271,such specific categories didn't even exist.,N39x_WTPix0
40271,42874,Sex was a mere fusion of bodies,N39x_WTPix0
42874,44484,or a trickle of DNA,N39x_WTPix0
44484,47026,shared between two or more beings.,N39x_WTPix0
47026,49351,It wasn't until about 500 million years ago,N39x_WTPix0
49351,52715,that we start to see structures akin to a penis,N39x_WTPix0
52715,55373,"or a thing that gives DNA out,",N39x_WTPix0
55373,58527,"and a vagina, something that receives it.",N39x_WTPix0
58527,60852,"Now invariably, you're probably thinking about",N39x_WTPix0
60852,63272,"what belongs to our own species,",N39x_WTPix0
63272,65170,"these very familiar structures,",N39x_WTPix0
65170,67456,but the diversity that we see in sexual structures,N39x_WTPix0
67456,69444,in the animal kingdom that has evolved,N39x_WTPix0
69444,72092,in response to the multitude of factors,N39x_WTPix0
72092,73753,surrounding reproduction,N39x_WTPix0
73753,76147,is pretty mind-blowing.,N39x_WTPix0
76147,79788,Penile diversity is especially profuse.,N39x_WTPix0
79788,81933,So this is a paper nautilus.,N39x_WTPix0
81933,84843,"It's a close relative of squid and octopus,",N39x_WTPix0
84843,87965,and males have a hectocotylus.,N39x_WTPix0

96303,99503,"finds the female through
pheromonal cues in the water,",N39x_WTPix0
99503,101414,attaches itself to her body,N39x_WTPix0
101414,102722,and deposits the sperm.,N39x_WTPix0
102722,105246,"For many decades, biologists actually felt",N39x_WTPix0
105246,109691,"that the hectocotylus was a
separate organism altogether.",N39x_WTPix0
109691,112679,"Now, the tapir is a mammal from South America.",N39x_WTPix0
112679,115627,And the tapir has a prehensile penis.,N39x_WTPix0
115627,118669,It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis,N39x_WTPix0
118669,121095,much akin to what we have with our hands.,N39x_WTPix0
121095,122767,And it uses this dexterity,N39x_WTPix0
122767,124983,to bypass the vagina altogether,N39x_WTPix0
124983,128354,"and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus,",N39x_WTPix0
128354,131908,not to mention it's a pretty good size.,N39x_WTPix0
131908,133837,"The biggest penis in the animal kingdom,",N39x_WTPix0
133837,135532,"however, is not that of the tapir.",N39x_WTPix0
135532,137864,The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio,N39x_WTPix0

139558,141809,"to the meager beach barnacle,",N39x_WTPix0
141809,144001,and this video is actually showing you,N39x_WTPix0
144001,146085,what the human penis would look like,N39x_WTPix0
146085,149546,if it were the same size as that of a barnacle.,N39x_WTPix0

416901,420198,A little guppy porn for you right there.,N39x_WTPix0
420198,422954,So we've seen very different strategies,N39x_WTPix0

433549,435606,We've also seen a titillation strategy,N39x_WTPix0

466974,469342,Female elephants and female hyenas,N39x_WTPix0

482633,486225,"So before a male can insert
his penis into a female's vagina,",N39x_WTPix0
486225,488080,she has to take this penile clitoris,N39x_WTPix0
488080,491643,and basically inside-out it in her own body.,N39x_WTPix0
491643,494580,"I mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.",N39x_WTPix0
494580,496112,It's simply not going to happen,N39x_WTPix0
496112,499434,unless the female is on board with the action.,N39x_WTPix0
499434,501247,"Now, even more interesting is the fact",N39x_WTPix0
501247,503256,that elephant and hyena societies,N39x_WTPix0
503256,505685,are entirely matriarchal:,N39x_WTPix0

515513,517596,"In hyena societies, adult males",N39x_WTPix0
517596,520858,are actually the lowest on the social scale.,N39x_WTPix0

545300,547957,The sexual strategies and reproductive structures,N39x_WTPix0

will react to each other,",N39x_WTPix0

37117,39412,Good afternoon.,Qprd1VNNNec
39412,43873,"As you're all aware, we face difficult economic times.",Qprd1VNNNec
43873,46325,I come to you with a modest proposal,Qprd1VNNNec
46325,48857,for easing the financial burden.,Qprd1VNNNec
48857,50390,This idea came to me while talking to,Qprd1VNNNec
50390,53362,a physicist friend of mine at MIT.,Qprd1VNNNec
53362,56051,He was struggling to explain something to me:,Qprd1VNNNec
56051,60627,a beautiful experiment that uses lasers to cool down matter.,Qprd1VNNNec
60627,62534,"Now he confused me from the very start,",Qprd1VNNNec
62534,64888,because light doesn't cool things down.,Qprd1VNNNec
64888,68337,It makes it hotter. It's happening right now.,Qprd1VNNNec
68337,70880,The reason that you can see me standing here is because,Qprd1VNNNec
70880,74652,"this room is filled with more than 100 quintillion photons,",Qprd1VNNNec
74652,78187,"and they're moving randomly through the space, near the speed of light.",Qprd1VNNNec
78187,79703,"All of them are different colors,",Qprd1VNNNec
79703,81643,"they're rippling with different frequencies,",Qprd1VNNNec
81643,84518,"and they're bouncing off every surface, including me,",Qprd1VNNNec
84518,86928,"and some of those are flying directly into your eyes,",Qprd1VNNNec
86928,90128,and that's why your brain is forming an image of me standing here.,Qprd1VNNNec
90128,91783,Now a laser is different.,Qprd1VNNNec
91783,95786,"It also uses photons, but they're all synchronized,",Qprd1VNNNec
95786,98493,"and if you focus them into a beam,",Qprd1VNNNec
98493,100888,what you have is an incredibly useful tool.,Qprd1VNNNec
100888,103024,The control of a laser is so precise,Qprd1VNNNec
103024,105698,"that you can perform surgery inside of an eye,",Qprd1VNNNec
105698,108343,"you can use it to store massive amounts of data,",Qprd1VNNNec
108343,110673,and you can use it for this beautiful experiment,Qprd1VNNNec
110673,113146,that my friend was struggling to explain.,Qprd1VNNNec
113146,116401,First you trap atoms in a special bottle.,Qprd1VNNNec
116401,119361,It uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms,Qprd1VNNNec
119361,121547,from the noise of the environment.,Qprd1VNNNec
121547,124030,"And the atoms themselves are quite violent,",Qprd1VNNNec
124030,128074,"but if you fire lasers that are precisely tuned to the right frequency,",Qprd1VNNNec
128074,130702,an atom will briefly absorb those photons,Qprd1VNNNec
130702,132585,and tend to slow down.,Qprd1VNNNec
132585,135897,Little by little it gets colder,Qprd1VNNNec
135897,140410,until eventually it approaches absolute zero.,Qprd1VNNNec
140410,143586,"Now if you use the right kind of atoms and you get them cold enough,",Qprd1VNNNec
143586,147363,something truly bizarre happens.,Qprd1VNNNec
147363,150185,"It's no longer a solid, a liquid or a gas.",Qprd1VNNNec
150185,154125,It enters a new state of matter called a superfluid.,Qprd1VNNNec
154125,156412,"The atoms lose their individual identity,",Qprd1VNNNec
156412,159239,"and the rules from the quantum world take over,",Qprd1VNNNec
159239,163334,and that's what gives superfluids such spooky properties.,Qprd1VNNNec
163334,166786,"For example, if you shine light through a superfluid,",Qprd1VNNNec
166786,169811,it is able to slow photons down,Qprd1VNNNec
169811,172970,to 60 kilometers per hour.,Qprd1VNNNec
179585,182638,Another spooky property is that it flows,Qprd1VNNNec
182638,185274,"with absolutely no viscosity or friction,",Qprd1VNNNec
185274,187538,"so if you were to take the lid off that bottle,",Qprd1VNNNec
187538,189633,it won't stay inside.,Qprd1VNNNec
189633,192410,"A thin film will creep up the inside wall,",Qprd1VNNNec
192410,196634,flow over the top and right out the outside.,Qprd1VNNNec
196634,199591,"Now of course, the moment that it does hit the outside environment,",Qprd1VNNNec
199591,203307,"and its temperature rises by even a fraction of a degree,",Qprd1VNNNec
203307,205430,it immediately turns back into normal matter.,Qprd1VNNNec
205430,208996,Superfluids are one of the most fragile things we've ever discovered.,Qprd1VNNNec
208996,211357,And this is the great pleasure of science:,Qprd1VNNNec
211357,215572,the defeat of our intuition through experimentation.,Qprd1VNNNec
215572,217261,"But the experiment is not the end of the story,",Qprd1VNNNec
217261,220787,because you still have to transmit that knowledge to other people.,Qprd1VNNNec
220787,223163,I have a Ph.D in molecular biology.,Qprd1VNNNec
223163,226696,I still barely understand what most scientists are talking about.,Qprd1VNNNec
226696,229646,"So as my friend was trying to explain that experiment,",Qprd1VNNNec
229646,232592,"it seemed like the more he said,",Qprd1VNNNec
232592,235565,the less I understood.,Qprd1VNNNec
235565,237936,Because if you're trying to give someone the big picture,Qprd1VNNNec
237936,242015,"of a complex idea, to really capture its essence,",Qprd1VNNNec
242015,245598,"the fewer words you use, the better.",Qprd1VNNNec
245598,248917,"In fact, the ideal may be to use no words at all.",Qprd1VNNNec
248917,250474,"I remember thinking, my friend could have explained",Qprd1VNNNec
250474,253606,that entire experiment with a dance.,Qprd1VNNNec
253606,257974,"Of course, there never seem to be any dancers around when you need them.",Qprd1VNNNec
257974,259863,"Now, the idea is not as crazy as it sounds.",Qprd1VNNNec
259863,263365,I started a contest four years ago called Dance Your Ph.D.,Qprd1VNNNec
263365,265980,"Instead of explaining their research with words,",Qprd1VNNNec
265980,268880,scientists have to explain it with dance.,Qprd1VNNNec
268880,271249,"Now surprisingly, it seems to work.",Qprd1VNNNec
271249,274521,Dance really can make science easier to understand.,Qprd1VNNNec
274521,276317,But don't take my word for it.,Qprd1VNNNec
276317,279204,"Go on the Internet and search for Dance Your Ph.D.""""",Qprd1VNNNec
279204,282462,There are hundreds of dancing scientists waiting for you.,Qprd1VNNNec
282462,284545,The most surprising thing that I've learned while running this contest,Qprd1VNNNec
284545,289834,is that some scientists are now working directly with dancers on their research.,Qprd1VNNNec
289834,291714,"For example, at the University of Minnesota,",Qprd1VNNNec
291714,294219,"there's a biomedical engineer named David Odde,",Qprd1VNNNec
294219,297377,and he works with dancers to study how cells move.,Qprd1VNNNec
297377,299786,They do it by changing their shape.,Qprd1VNNNec
299786,302605,"When a chemical signal washes up on one side,",Qprd1VNNNec
302605,305730,"it triggers the cell to expand its shape on that side,",Qprd1VNNNec
305730,309011,because the cell is constantly touching and tugging at the environment.,Qprd1VNNNec
309011,312982,So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions.,Qprd1VNNNec
312982,316920,But what seems so slow and graceful from the outside,Qprd1VNNNec
316920,319349,"is really more like chaos inside,",Qprd1VNNNec
319349,323752,"because cells control their shape with a skeleton of rigid protein fibers,",Qprd1VNNNec
323752,326597,and those fibers are constantly falling apart.,Qprd1VNNNec
326597,329166,"But just as quickly as they explode,",Qprd1VNNNec
329166,331583,"more proteins attach to the ends and grow them longer,",Qprd1VNNNec
331583,333766,so it's constantly changing,Qprd1VNNNec
333766,336764,just to remain exactly the same.,Qprd1VNNNec
336764,339934,"Now, David builds mathematical models of this and then he tests those in the lab,",Qprd1VNNNec
339934,342709,"but before he does that, he works with dancers",Qprd1VNNNec
342709,346410,to figure out what kinds of models to build in the first place.,Qprd1VNNNec
346410,349503,"It's basically efficient brainstorming,",Qprd1VNNNec
349503,351758,"and when I visited David to learn about his research,",Qprd1VNNNec
351758,355102,he used dancers to explain it to me,Qprd1VNNNec
355102,359644,rather than the usual method: PowerPoint.,Qprd1VNNNec
359644,361997,And this brings me to my modest proposal.,Qprd1VNNNec
361997,364866,I think that bad PowerPoint presentations,Qprd1VNNNec
364866,367538,are a serious threat to the global economy.,Qprd1VNNNec
367538,375467,(Laughter) (Applause),Qprd1VNNNec
375467,380346,"Now it does depend on how you measure it, of course,",Qprd1VNNNec
380346,385115,but one estimate has put the drain at 250 million dollars per day.,Qprd1VNNNec
385115,387296,Now that assumes half-hour presentations,Qprd1VNNNec
387296,389353,for an average audience of four people,Qprd1VNNNec
389353,391672,"with salaries of 35,000 dollars,",Qprd1VNNNec
391672,393632,and it conservatively assumes that,Qprd1VNNNec
393632,397564,"about a quarter of the presentations are a complete waste of time,",Qprd1VNNNec
397564,400143,and given that there are some apparently,Qprd1VNNNec
400143,403415,"30 million PowerPoint presentations created every day,",Qprd1VNNNec
403415,406303,that would indeed add up to an annual waste,Qprd1VNNNec
406303,409399,of 100 billion dollars.,Qprd1VNNNec
409399,411767,"Of course, that's just the time we're losing",Qprd1VNNNec
411767,413990,sitting through presentations.,Qprd1VNNNec
413990,418306,"There are other costs, because PowerPoint is a tool,",Qprd1VNNNec
418306,421636,"and like any tool, it can and will be abused.",Qprd1VNNNec
421636,424126,"To borrow a concept from my country's CIA,",Qprd1VNNNec
424126,427241,it helps you to soften up your audience.,Qprd1VNNNec
427241,431489,"It distracts them with pretty pictures, irrelevant data.",Qprd1VNNNec
431489,435229,"It allows you to create the illusion of competence,",Qprd1VNNNec
435229,437989,"the illusion of simplicity,",Qprd1VNNNec
437989,442716,"and most destructively, the illusion of understanding.",Qprd1VNNNec
442716,446960,So now my country is 15 trillion dollars in debt.,Qprd1VNNNec
446960,451945,Our leaders are working tirelessly to try and find ways to save money.,Qprd1VNNNec
451945,456414,One idea is to drastically reduce public support for the arts.,Qprd1VNNNec
456414,458622,"For example, our National Endowment for the Arts,",Qprd1VNNNec
458622,461199,"with its $150 million budget,",Qprd1VNNNec
461199,464211,slashing that program would immediately reduce the national debt,Qprd1VNNNec
464211,467572,by about one one-thousandth of a percent.,Qprd1VNNNec
467572,469312,One certainly can't argue with those numbers.,Qprd1VNNNec
469312,474594,"However, once we eliminate public funding for the arts,",Qprd1VNNNec
474594,477266,there will be some drawbacks.,Qprd1VNNNec
477266,481662,The artists on the street will swell the ranks of the unemployed.,Qprd1VNNNec
481662,484069,"Many will turn to drug abuse and prostitution,",Qprd1VNNNec
484069,487188,and that will inevitably lower property values in urban neighborhoods.,Qprd1VNNNec
487188,492095,All of this could wipe out the savings we're hoping to make in the first place.,Qprd1VNNNec
492095,495336,"I shall now, therefore, humbly propose my own thoughts,",Qprd1VNNNec
495336,499118,which I hope will not be liable to the least objection.,Qprd1VNNNec
499118,501011,"Once we eliminate public funding for the artists,",Qprd1VNNNec
501011,502598,let's put them back to work,Qprd1VNNNec
502598,505619,by using them instead of PowerPoint.,Qprd1VNNNec
505619,509102,"As a test case, I propose we start with American dancers.",Qprd1VNNNec
509102,511255,"After all, they are the most perishable of their kind,",Qprd1VNNNec
511255,513414,prone to injury and very slow to heal,Qprd1VNNNec
513414,516231,due to our health care system.,Qprd1VNNNec
516231,519374,"Rather than dancing our Ph.Ds,",Qprd1VNNNec
519374,522988,we should use dance to explain all of our complex problems.,Qprd1VNNNec
522988,525848,Imagine our politicians using dance,Qprd1VNNNec
525848,529626,to explain why we must invade a foreign country,Qprd1VNNNec
529626,532498,or bail out an investment bank.,Qprd1VNNNec
532498,534460,It's sure to help.,Qprd1VNNNec
534460,538212,"Of course someday, in the deep future,",Qprd1VNNNec
538212,540593,a technology of persuasion,Qprd1VNNNec
540593,544022,"even more powerful than PowerPoint may be invented,",Qprd1VNNNec
544022,547566,rendering dancers unnecessary as tools of rhetoric.,Qprd1VNNNec
547566,550142,"However, I trust that by that day,",Qprd1VNNNec
550142,553457,we shall have passed this present financial calamity.,Qprd1VNNNec
553457,556823,Perhaps by then we will be able to afford the luxury,Qprd1VNNNec
556823,559943,of just sitting in an audience,Qprd1VNNNec
559943,561783,with no other purpose,Qprd1VNNNec
561783,566349,than to witness the human form in motion.,Qprd1VNNNec

25000,28000,What I want to talk to you about today is,SuWH0ETXTfE
28000,37000,"virtual worlds, digital globes, the 3-D Web, the Metaverse.",SuWH0ETXTfE
37000,39000,What does this all mean for us?,SuWH0ETXTfE
39000,44000,What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again.,SuWH0ETXTfE
44000,47000,It's going to become super exciting as we transform,SuWH0ETXTfE
47000,51000,to this highly immersive and interactive world.,SuWH0ETXTfE
51000,54000,"With graphics, computing power, low latencies,",SuWH0ETXTfE
54000,57000,these types of applications and possibilities,SuWH0ETXTfE
57000,62000,are going to stream rich data into your lives.,SuWH0ETXTfE
62000,67000,"So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives,",SuWH0ETXTfE
67000,73000,are all about extending our current search metaphor.,SuWH0ETXTfE
73000,76000,"When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web,",SuWH0ETXTfE
76000,79000,"remembering URLs, saving favorites.",SuWH0ETXTfE
79000,82000,"As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings,",SuWH0ETXTfE
82000,85000,"the Web matching, the index crawling.",SuWH0ETXTfE
85000,87000,But we want to use our brain!,SuWH0ETXTfE
87000,90000,"We want to navigate, explore, discover information.",SuWH0ETXTfE
90000,95000,"In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat.",SuWH0ETXTfE
95000,99000,We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer.,SuWH0ETXTfE
99000,103000,So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat,SuWH0ETXTfE
103000,106000,than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day?,SuWH0ETXTfE
106000,110000,Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?,SuWH0ETXTfE
110000,113000,So Virtual Earth is about starting off,SuWH0ETXTfE
113000,118000,"creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.",SuWH0ETXTfE
118000,121000,What we want to do is mix in all types of data.,SuWH0ETXTfE
121000,126000,"Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth,",SuWH0ETXTfE
126000,129000,"global perspective, local knowledge.",SuWH0ETXTfE
129000,131000,"So when you think about this problem,",SuWH0ETXTfE
131000,135000,what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin?,SuWH0ETXTfE
135000,139000,"Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes,",SuWH0ETXTfE
139000,142000,"from ground vehicles, from people.",SuWH0ETXTfE
142000,147000,"This process is an engineering problem,",SuWH0ETXTfE
147000,151000,"a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.",SuWH0ETXTfE
151000,153000,Here is an example of our aerial camera.,SuWH0ETXTfE
153000,156000,This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones.,SuWH0ETXTfE
156000,158000,"In addition, it's multi-spectral.",SuWH0ETXTfE
158000,162000,"We collect four gigabits per second of data,",SuWH0ETXTfE
162000,164000,if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.,SuWH0ETXTfE
164000,170000,That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity.,SuWH0ETXTfE
170000,174000,"We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.",SuWH0ETXTfE
174000,177000,"You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints,",SuWH0ETXTfE

220260,223260,"but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.",Ht6TTA8z3MI
223260,225260,"But also, our hearts are in our throats",Ht6TTA8z3MI
225260,227260,"a huge amount of the time,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
227260,229260,"because we're driving through water,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
229260,231260,and it's an unknown territory.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
231260,233260,But we're really there,Ht6TTA8z3MI
233260,236260,seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
236260,238260,"DJ: Now one of the big things, of course,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
238260,241260,"everybody knows that cats hate water,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
241260,243260,and so this was a real revelation for us.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
243260,246260,"And we could only find this by pushing ourselves,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
246260,249260,by going where no sane person should go --,Ht6TTA8z3MI
251260,254260,"not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly --",Ht6TTA8z3MI
254260,256260,"and just pushing the envelope,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
256260,259260,"going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.",Ht6TTA8z3MI
259260,261260,But we've managed to find that these lions,Ht6TTA8z3MI
261260,263260,"are 15 percent bigger than any others,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
263260,266260,and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
267260,269260,"BJ: And then of course, the challenge",Ht6TTA8z3MI
269260,272260,is knowing when to turn around.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
272260,274260,"We don't always get that right,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
274260,276260,"and on this particular day,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
276260,279260,we seriously underestimated the depth.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
279260,281260,"We got deeper and deeper,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
281260,283260,until it was at Dereck's chest-height.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
283260,286260,"Well then we hit a deep depression,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
286260,289260,and we seriously submerged the vehicle.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
289260,291260,We actually managed to drown,Ht6TTA8z3MI
291260,294260,two million dollars' worth of camera gear.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
294260,296260,"We drowned our pride, I must tell you,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
296260,298260,"which was really serious,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
298260,301260,and we seized the engine.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
301260,303260,"DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle",Ht6TTA8z3MI
303260,305260,is that he who drowns the vehicle,Ht6TTA8z3MI
305260,307260,gets to swim with the crocodiles.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
307260,309260,(Laughter),Ht6TTA8z3MI
309260,311260,You will notice also that all of these images here,Ht6TTA8z3MI

315260,318260,(Laughter),Ht6TTA8z3MI
318260,321260,But all the places we get stuck in really have great views.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
321260,324260,"And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
324260,326260,and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
326260,328260,BJ: But we truly do,Ht6TTA8z3MI
328260,330260,spend day and night,Ht6TTA8z3MI

341260,343260,lions and hyenas.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
343260,346260,"And surprisingly, it became a cult film.",Ht6TTA8z3MI
346260,348260,And we can only work that out,Ht6TTA8z3MI
348260,350260,as people were seeing parallels,Ht6TTA8z3MI
350260,353260,between the thuggish side of nature,Ht6TTA8z3MI

438260,441260,and this is probably a highlight of our career --,Ht6TTA8z3MI

454260,456260,"not in the lungs,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
456260,458260,"and that's when people give up hope,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
458260,460260,or when any life form gives up hope.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
460260,463260,And you can see the start of it here.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
464260,467260,"This elephant, against overwhelming odds,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
467260,469260,simply gives up hope.,Ht6TTA8z3MI

484260,487260,you can get your hope back again.,Ht6TTA8z3MI

531260,533260,Now back to the leopard.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
533260,535260,We were spending so much time with this leopard,Ht6TTA8z3MI

537260,539260,"her personal character,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
539260,542260,that maybe we were taking it a little bit far.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
542260,544260,"We were perhaps taking her for granted,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
544260,546260,and maybe she didn't like that that much.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
546260,548260,"This is about couples working together,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
548260,551260,and so I do need to say that within the vehicle,Ht6TTA8z3MI
551260,554260,"we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.",Ht6TTA8z3MI
554260,556260,Beverly sits on the one side,Ht6TTA8z3MI
556260,558260,"where all her camera gear is,",Ht6TTA8z3MI

561260,564260,"These are precious to us, these divides.",Ht6TTA8z3MI
564260,566260,BJ: But when this little cub saw,Ht6TTA8z3MI
566260,568260,that I had vacated my seat,Ht6TTA8z3MI
568260,570260,"and climbed to the back to get some camera gear,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
570260,572260,she came in like a curious cat,Ht6TTA8z3MI
572260,574260,to come and investigate.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
574260,577260,"It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful",Ht6TTA8z3MI
577260,579260,that she trusted us to that extent.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
579260,581260,"But at the same time, we were concerned",Ht6TTA8z3MI
581260,583260,that if she created this as a habit,Ht6TTA8z3MI
583260,585260,"and jumped into somebody else's car,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
585260,587260,it might not turn out the same way --,Ht6TTA8z3MI
587260,589260,she might get shot for that.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
589260,592260,So we knew we had to react quickly.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
592260,595260,And the only way we thought we could,Ht6TTA8z3MI
595260,597260,without scaring her,Ht6TTA8z3MI
597260,599260,is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make --,Ht6TTA8z3MI
599260,601260,a hiss and a sound.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
601260,603260,So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car --,Ht6TTA8z3MI
603260,605260,very innovative.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
605260,607260,"DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage,",Ht6TTA8z3MI

612260,614260,"But really and truly, this was how",Ht6TTA8z3MI
614260,616260,this little leopard was displaying,Ht6TTA8z3MI
616260,618260,her individual personality.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
618260,620260,But nothing prepared us,Ht6TTA8z3MI
620260,622260,"for what happened next in our relationship with her,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
622260,624260,when she started hunting.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
624260,627260,"BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.",Ht6TTA8z3MI
627260,629260,It was like watching a graduation ceremony.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
629260,631260,We felt like we were surrogate parents.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
631260,633260,"And of course, we knew now",Ht6TTA8z3MI
633260,635260,that she was going to survive.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
635260,638260,But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon,Ht6TTA8z3MI
638260,640260,clinging to the mother's fur,Ht6TTA8z3MI
640260,642260,did we realize that something very unique,Ht6TTA8z3MI
642260,645260,was taking place here with Legadema.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
645260,648260,"And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
648260,650260,it didn't turn and run.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
650260,652260,So what we watched,Ht6TTA8z3MI
652260,654260,over the next couple of hours,Ht6TTA8z3MI
654260,656260,was very unique.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
657260,659260,It was absolutely amazing,Ht6TTA8z3MI
659260,661260,"when she picked it up to safety,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
661260,664260,protecting it from the hyena.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
664260,667260,"And over the next five hours,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
667260,669260,she took care of it.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
669260,672260,"We realized that we actually don't know everything,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
672260,676260,"and that nature is so unpredictable,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
676260,679260,we have to be open at all times.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
679260,681260,"DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.",Ht6TTA8z3MI
681260,686260,(Laughter),Ht6TTA8z3MI
686260,689260,"But in fact,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
690260,693260,what we were seeing here was interesting.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
693260,696260,"Because she is a cub wanting to play,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
696260,699260,"but she was also a predator needing to kill,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
699260,701260,"and yet conflicted in some way,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
701260,704260,because she was also an emerging mother.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
704260,706260,"She had this maternal instinct,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
706260,709260,"much like a young girl on her way to womanhood,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
710260,713260,and so this really took us to this new level,Ht6TTA8z3MI
713260,716260,of understanding that personality.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
718260,721260,"BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.",Ht6TTA8z3MI
721260,723260,They ended up sleeping for hours.,Ht6TTA8z3MI

727260,729260,"It did die,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
729260,732260,and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
733260,735260,"DJ: So at this stage, I guess,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
735260,737260,"we had very, very firm ideas",Ht6TTA8z3MI
737260,739260,on what conservation meant.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
739260,742260,We had to deal with these individual personalities.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
742260,745260,We had to deal with them with respect,Ht6TTA8z3MI
745260,747260,and celebrate them.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
747260,750260,"And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative",Ht6TTA8z3MI
750260,752260,"to march forward into conservation,",Ht6TTA8z3MI
752260,754260,taking care of the big cats that we loved --,Ht6TTA8z3MI
754260,757260,and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years,Ht6TTA8z3MI
757260,760260,to see how well we had all collectively been doing.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
760260,762260,"So when Beverly and I were born,",Ht6TTA8z3MI

900260,903260,and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
903260,905260,So we've estimated,Ht6TTA8z3MI

911260,913260,somewhere in a far-off place.,Ht6TTA8z3MI
913260,915260,DJ: So what our investigations have shown,Ht6TTA8z3MI
915260,917260,is that these lions are essential.,Ht6TTA8z3MI

12160,15160,"It's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rules",VIgzTLDyObo
15160,19160,that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing.,VIgzTLDyObo
19160,23160,Most of them are pretty basic.,VIgzTLDyObo
23160,26160,Number one: don't let go --,VIgzTLDyObo
26160,28160,very sure success method.,VIgzTLDyObo
28160,31160,"But really, truly -- often you think about",VIgzTLDyObo
31160,33160,letting go way before your body does.,VIgzTLDyObo
33160,35160,"So hang in there,",VIgzTLDyObo
35160,39160,and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions.,VIgzTLDyObo
39160,41160,Number two: hesitation is bad.,VIgzTLDyObo
41160,44160,"This is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows,",VIgzTLDyObo
44160,46160,in the Yosemite high country.,VIgzTLDyObo
46160,50160,Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges.,VIgzTLDyObo
50160,54160,You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock.,VIgzTLDyObo
54160,58160,The most friction you have is when you first put your hand,VIgzTLDyObo
58160,61160,or your foot on the rock.,VIgzTLDyObo
61160,65160,"And then from that point on, you're basically falling.",VIgzTLDyObo
65160,68160,So momentum is good. Don't stop.,VIgzTLDyObo
68160,70160,Rule number three: have a plan.,VIgzTLDyObo
70160,72160,"This is a climb called the Naked Edge,",VIgzTLDyObo
72160,74160,"in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder.",VIgzTLDyObo
74160,77160,This climber is on the last pitch of it.,VIgzTLDyObo
77160,79160,He's actually right about where I fell.,VIgzTLDyObo
79160,82160,"There is about 1,000 feet of air below him.",VIgzTLDyObo
82160,85160,And all the hard pitches are actually below him.,VIgzTLDyObo
85160,87160,Often what happens is,VIgzTLDyObo
87160,89160,"you're planning so hard for like,",VIgzTLDyObo
89160,92160,"How do I get through the hardest part? How do I get through the hardest part?""""",VIgzTLDyObo
92160,94160,And then what happens?,VIgzTLDyObo
94160,96160,You get to the last pitch. It's easy.,VIgzTLDyObo
96160,99160,And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it.,VIgzTLDyObo
99160,102160,You have to plan ahead to get to the top.,VIgzTLDyObo
102160,105160,But you also can't forget that each individual move,VIgzTLDyObo
105160,107160,you have to be able to complete.,VIgzTLDyObo
107160,109160,"This is a climb called the Dike Route,",VIgzTLDyObo
109160,113160,"on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.",VIgzTLDyObo
113160,116160,The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard.,VIgzTLDyObo
116160,118160,"But if you're the leader on it,",VIgzTLDyObo
118160,122160,"at the hardest move, you're looking at about 100 foot fall,",VIgzTLDyObo
122160,124160,onto some low angle slabs.,VIgzTLDyObo
124160,126160,So you've got to focus.,VIgzTLDyObo
126160,129160,You don't want to stop in the middle like,VIgzTLDyObo
129160,131160,Coleridge's Kubla Kahn.,VIgzTLDyObo
131160,133160,You've got to keep going.,VIgzTLDyObo
133160,135160,Rule number five: know how to rest.,VIgzTLDyObo
135160,137160,It's amazing. The best climbers,VIgzTLDyObo
137160,140160,are the ones that in the most extreme situations,VIgzTLDyObo
140160,142160,can get their bodies into some position,VIgzTLDyObo
142160,144160,"where they can rest,",VIgzTLDyObo
144160,147160,"regroup, calm themselves, focus,",VIgzTLDyObo
147160,151160,and keep going.,VIgzTLDyObo
151160,153160,"This is a climb in the Needles, again in California.",VIgzTLDyObo
153160,155160,Fear really sucks because what it means is,VIgzTLDyObo
155160,158160,you're not focusing on what you're doing.,VIgzTLDyObo
158160,160160,You're focusing on the consequences of,VIgzTLDyObo
160160,163160,failing at what you're doing,VIgzTLDyObo
163160,165160,because any given move should require,VIgzTLDyObo
165160,170160,all your concentration and thought processes,VIgzTLDyObo
170160,172160,to execute it effectively.,VIgzTLDyObo
172160,175160,"One of the things in climbing is, most people",VIgzTLDyObo
175160,179160,sort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution.,VIgzTLDyObo
179160,182160,"This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming,",VIgzTLDyObo
182160,185160,which is a columnar basalt formation,VIgzTLDyObo
185160,188160,"that most of you probably know from Close Encounters.""""",VIgzTLDyObo
188160,190160,"With this, typically crack climbers",VIgzTLDyObo
190160,192160,would put their hands in and their toes in,VIgzTLDyObo
192160,194160,and just start climbing.,VIgzTLDyObo
194160,197160,The cracks are too small to get your toes into,VIgzTLDyObo
197160,200160,so the only way to climb is using your fingertips,VIgzTLDyObo
200160,202160,"in the cracks,",VIgzTLDyObo
202160,204160,and using opposing pressure,VIgzTLDyObo
204160,207160,and forcing yourself up.,VIgzTLDyObo
207160,210160,Rule number eight: strength doesn't always equal success.,VIgzTLDyObo
210160,212160,In the 35 years I've been a climbing guide,VIgzTLDyObo
212160,214160,"and taught on indoor walls, and stuff like that,",VIgzTLDyObo
214160,216160,the most important thing I've learned,VIgzTLDyObo
216160,219160,"was, guys will always try to do pull-ups.",VIgzTLDyObo
219160,221160,"Beginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash,",VIgzTLDyObo
221160,223160,they get 15 feet up --,VIgzTLDyObo
223160,225160,and they can do about 15 pull-ups right --,VIgzTLDyObo
225160,227160,And then they just flame out.,VIgzTLDyObo
227160,229160,Women are much more in balance,VIgzTLDyObo
229160,232160,because they don't have that idea,VIgzTLDyObo
232160,234160,that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups.,VIgzTLDyObo
234160,237160,They think about how to get the weight over their feet,VIgzTLDyObo
237160,240160,because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long.,VIgzTLDyObo
240160,242160,"So balance is really critical,",VIgzTLDyObo
242160,244160,"and keeping your weight on your feet,",VIgzTLDyObo
244160,246160,which is your strongest muscle.,VIgzTLDyObo
246160,248160,And of course there is rule number nine.,VIgzTLDyObo
248160,250160,I came up with rule number nine after,VIgzTLDyObo
250160,252160,"I actually didn't plan for a fall,",VIgzTLDyObo
252160,255160,and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib.,VIgzTLDyObo
255160,258160,"Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen,",VIgzTLDyObo
258160,261160,you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go,VIgzTLDyObo
261160,264160,because that is the critical piece,VIgzTLDyObo
264160,266160,of not getting hurt --,VIgzTLDyObo
266160,270160,"how you're going to fall onto the rope,",VIgzTLDyObo
270160,272160,"or if you're climbing without a rope,",VIgzTLDyObo
272160,276160,fall to a place where you can actually control the fall.,VIgzTLDyObo
276160,279160,So don't hang on till the bitter end.,VIgzTLDyObo

1200000,1201000,(Applause),bG2QKbpjDqo
1201000,1207000,"And finally, because they are both standing at my -- I'm out of time.",bG2QKbpjDqo
1207000,1210000,Am I out of time?,bG2QKbpjDqo
1210000,1213000,"OK, so let me not forget my punchline.",bG2QKbpjDqo
1213000,1216000,One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is,bG2QKbpjDqo
1216000,1225000,"to support women, to create jobs. (Applause)",bG2QKbpjDqo
1225000,1227000,"A lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.",bG2QKbpjDqo
1227000,1229000,But there are people -- women -- creating jobs.,bG2QKbpjDqo
1230000,1232000,"And we know, studies have shown",bG2QKbpjDqo
1232000,1235000,that when you put resources in the hand of the woman --,bG2QKbpjDqo
1235000,1237000,"in fact, there's an econometric study,",bG2QKbpjDqo
1237000,1240000,"the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that",bG2QKbpjDqo
1240000,1243000,transfers into the hands of women result,bG2QKbpjDqo
1243000,1246000,"in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.",bG2QKbpjDqo
1248000,1250000,So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here --,bG2QKbpjDqo
1251000,1252000,I'm not saying the men are not important --,bG2QKbpjDqo
1252000,1255000,"obviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?",bG2QKbpjDqo
1255000,1257000,"They'll come back home and get disgruntled,",bG2QKbpjDqo
1257000,1260000,and it will result in difficulties we don't want.,bG2QKbpjDqo
1261000,1263000,We don't want men beating their wives,bG2QKbpjDqo
1263000,1265000,"because they don't have a job, and so on.",bG2QKbpjDqo
1266000,1269000,"But at the margin, we also -- I want to push this,",bG2QKbpjDqo
1269000,1272000,because the reason is the men automatically --,bG2QKbpjDqo
1273000,1276000,"they get -- not automatically, but they tend to get more support.",bG2QKbpjDqo
1278000,1281000,But I want you to realize that resources,bG2QKbpjDqo
1281000,1285000,in the hands of African women is a powerful tool.,bG2QKbpjDqo
1285000,1289000,There are people creating jobs.,bG2QKbpjDqo
1289000,1291000,Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.,bG2QKbpjDqo
1291000,1295000,"We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.",bG2QKbpjDqo
1296000,1297000,She wants to expand.,bG2QKbpjDqo
1298000,1300000,She needs another 20 million.,bG2QKbpjDqo
1300000,1303000,"She will create another 100, 200 more jobs.",bG2QKbpjDqo
1304000,1308000,So take away from here is how are you going to put together,bG2QKbpjDqo
1308000,1310000,the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle,bG2QKbpjDqo
1310000,1314000,who are ready --,bG2QKbpjDqo
1314000,1316000,business people who want to expand and create more jobs.,bG2QKbpjDqo
1317000,1321000,"And lastly, what are you going to do",bG2QKbpjDqo
1322000,1327000,"to be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sector",bG2QKbpjDqo
1327000,1330000,and the African as an individual?,bG2QKbpjDqo
1330000,1339000,Thank you. (Applause),bG2QKbpjDqo
12160,15160,Today I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.,GOCUH7TxHRI
15160,17160,And the problem I'm going to talk about,GOCUH7TxHRI
17160,20160,"is not the familiar one from philosophy,",GOCUH7TxHRI
20160,22160,"which is, How can we know""",GOCUH7TxHRI
22160,24160,"whether other people have minds?""
6;24160;26160;That is, maybe you have a mind,""",GOCUH7TxHRI
26160,29160,and everyone else is just a really convincing robot.,GOCUH7TxHRI
29160,31160,"So that's a problem in philosophy,",GOCUH7TxHRI
31160,33160,but for today's purposes I'm going to assume,GOCUH7TxHRI
33160,35160,"that many people in this audience have a mind,",GOCUH7TxHRI
35160,37160,and that I don't have to worry about this.,GOCUH7TxHRI
37160,40160,There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us,GOCUH7TxHRI
40160,43160,as parents and teachers and spouses,GOCUH7TxHRI
43160,45160,"and novelists,",GOCUH7TxHRI
45160,47160,"which is, Why is it so hard""",GOCUH7TxHRI
47160,49160,"to know what somebody else wants or believes?""

51160,54160,"Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?""""",GOCUH7TxHRI
54160,56160,I think novelists put this best.,GOCUH7TxHRI

58160,61160,"And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business""",GOCUH7TxHRI
61160,63160,of other people?,GOCUH7TxHRI
63160,65160,"So ill equipped are we all,",GOCUH7TxHRI
65160,67160,to envision one another's interior workings,GOCUH7TxHRI

26;69160;72160;So as a teacher and as a spouse,""",GOCUH7TxHRI
72160,74160,"this is, of course, a problem I confront every day.",GOCUH7TxHRI
74160,77160,"But as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds,",GOCUH7TxHRI
77160,80160,and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today.,GOCUH7TxHRI
80160,82160,"And that problem is, How is it so easy""",GOCUH7TxHRI
82160,84160,"to know other minds?""
32;84160;86160;So to start with an illustration,""",GOCUH7TxHRI
86160,88160,"you need almost no information,",GOCUH7TxHRI
88160,90160,"one snapshot of a stranger,",GOCUH7TxHRI
90160,92160,"to guess what this woman is thinking,",GOCUH7TxHRI
92160,95160,or what this man is.,GOCUH7TxHRI
95160,97160,"And put another way, the crux of the problem is",GOCUH7TxHRI
97160,100160,"the machine that we use for thinking about other minds,",GOCUH7TxHRI
100160,103160,"our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells,",GOCUH7TxHRI
103160,105160,"that we share with all other animals, with monkeys",GOCUH7TxHRI
105160,108160,and mice and even sea slugs.,GOCUH7TxHRI
108160,111160,"And yet, you put them together in a particular network,",GOCUH7TxHRI
111160,114160,and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.,GOCUH7TxHRI
114160,116160,"Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did,",GOCUH7TxHRI
116160,119160,"I know you think you understand what you thought I said,""",GOCUH7TxHRI
119160,121160,but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard,GOCUH7TxHRI
121160,123160,"is not what I meant.""
48;123160;126160;(Laughter)""",GOCUH7TxHRI
126160,128160,"So, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience",GOCUH7TxHRI
128160,130160,"is to stand with these ideas,",GOCUH7TxHRI
130160,132160,one in each hand.,GOCUH7TxHRI
132160,135160,And to try to understand how you can put together,GOCUH7TxHRI
135160,139160,"simple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network,",GOCUH7TxHRI
139160,143160,and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.,GOCUH7TxHRI
143160,146160,So I'm going to tell you three things about this today.,GOCUH7TxHRI
146160,149160,Obviously the whole project here is huge.,GOCUH7TxHRI
149160,152160,And I'm going to tell you just our first few steps,GOCUH7TxHRI
152160,154160,about the discovery of a special brain region,GOCUH7TxHRI
154160,156160,for thinking about other people's thoughts.,GOCUH7TxHRI
156160,158160,Some observations on the slow development of this system,GOCUH7TxHRI
158160,162160,as we learn how to do this difficult job.,GOCUH7TxHRI
162160,164160,"And then finally, to show that some of the differences",GOCUH7TxHRI
164160,167160,"between people, in how we judge others,",GOCUH7TxHRI
167160,171160,can be explained by differences in this brain system.,GOCUH7TxHRI
171160,173160,"So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that",GOCUH7TxHRI
173160,176160,"there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains,",GOCUH7TxHRI
176160,179160,whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.,GOCUH7TxHRI
179160,181160,This is a picture of it.,GOCUH7TxHRI
181160,183160,It's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.,GOCUH7TxHRI
183160,185160,It's above and behind your right ear.,GOCUH7TxHRI
185160,187160,"And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you,",GOCUH7TxHRI
187160,189160,or when you read Romeo and Juliet,GOCUH7TxHRI
189160,192160,or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.,GOCUH7TxHRI
192160,196160,And you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.,GOCUH7TxHRI
196160,199160,So this brain region is called the Right TPJ.,GOCUH7TxHRI
199160,201160,And this picture shows the average activation,GOCUH7TxHRI
201160,203160,in a group of what we call typical human adults.,GOCUH7TxHRI
203160,205160,They're MIT undergraduates.,GOCUH7TxHRI
205160,209160,(Laughter),GOCUH7TxHRI
209160,211160,The second thing I want to say about this brain system,GOCUH7TxHRI
211160,213160,is that although we human adults,GOCUH7TxHRI
213160,215160,"are really good at understanding other minds,",GOCUH7TxHRI
215160,217160,we weren't always that way.,GOCUH7TxHRI
217160,220160,It takes children a long time to break into the system.,GOCUH7TxHRI
220160,224160,"I'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process.",GOCUH7TxHRI
224160,227160,"The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five,",GOCUH7TxHRI
227160,229160,as kids learn to understand,GOCUH7TxHRI
229160,232160,that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own.,GOCUH7TxHRI
232160,234160,So I'm going to show you a five-year-old,GOCUH7TxHRI
234160,236160,who is getting a standard kind of puzzle,GOCUH7TxHRI
236160,239160,that we call the false belief task.,GOCUH7TxHRI
239160,242160,Rebecca Saxe (Video): This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan.,GOCUH7TxHRI
242160,244160,And you know what pirates really like?,GOCUH7TxHRI
244160,247160,Child: What? RS: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches.,GOCUH7TxHRI
247160,250160,Child: Cheese? I love cheese!,GOCUH7TxHRI
250160,252160,"RS: Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich,",GOCUH7TxHRI
252160,254160,"and he says, Yum yum yum yum yum!""",GOCUH7TxHRI
254160,256160,"I really love cheese sandwiches.""
99;256160;260160;And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.""",GOCUH7TxHRI
260160,264160,"And Ivan says, You know what? I need a drink with my lunch.""""",GOCUH7TxHRI
264160,267160,And so Ivan goes to get a drink.,GOCUH7TxHRI
267160,269160,And while Ivan is away,GOCUH7TxHRI
269160,272160,"the wind comes,",GOCUH7TxHRI
272160,274160,and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.,GOCUH7TxHRI
274160,278160,"And now, here comes the other pirate.",GOCUH7TxHRI
278160,281160,This pirate is called Joshua.,GOCUH7TxHRI
281160,283160,And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.,GOCUH7TxHRI
283160,285160,"So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says,",GOCUH7TxHRI
285160,289160,"Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches.""""",GOCUH7TxHRI
289160,292160,And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest.,GOCUH7TxHRI
292160,294160,"Child: So, that one is his.",GOCUH7TxHRI
294160,296160,RS: That one is Joshua's. That's right.,GOCUH7TxHRI
296160,298160,Child: And then his went on the ground.,GOCUH7TxHRI
298160,300160,RS: That's exactly right.,GOCUH7TxHRI
300160,302160,Child: So he won't know which one is his.,GOCUH7TxHRI
302160,305160,RS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.,GOCUH7TxHRI
305160,309160,"Ivan comes back and he says, I want my cheese sandwich.""""",GOCUH7TxHRI
309160,312160,So which one do you think Ivan is going to take?,GOCUH7TxHRI
312160,314160,Child: I think he is going to take that one.,GOCUH7TxHRI
314160,316160,"RS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see.",GOCUH7TxHRI
316160,319160,"Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one.",GOCUH7TxHRI
319160,321160,So that's a five-year-old who clearly understands,GOCUH7TxHRI
321160,323160,that other people can have false beliefs,GOCUH7TxHRI
323160,325160,and what the consequences are for their actions.,GOCUH7TxHRI
325160,328160,Now I'm going to show you a three-year-old,GOCUH7TxHRI
328160,330160,who got the same puzzle.,GOCUH7TxHRI
330160,332160,"RS: And Ivan says, I want my cheese sandwich.""""",GOCUH7TxHRI
332160,335160,Which sandwich is he going to take?,GOCUH7TxHRI
335160,337160,Do you think he's going to take that one? Let's see what happens.,GOCUH7TxHRI
337160,339160,Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan.,GOCUH7TxHRI
339160,342160,"And he says, I want my cheese sandwich.""""",GOCUH7TxHRI
342160,344160,And he takes this one.,GOCUH7TxHRI
344160,347160,Uh-oh. Why did he take that one?,GOCUH7TxHRI
347160,351160,Child: His was on the grass.,GOCUH7TxHRI
351160,354160,So the three-year-old does two things differently.,GOCUH7TxHRI
354160,357160,"First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich",GOCUH7TxHRI
357160,359160,that's really his.,GOCUH7TxHRI
359160,363160,"And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his,",GOCUH7TxHRI
363160,366160,"where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his,",GOCUH7TxHRI
366160,369160,the three-year-old comes up with another explanation:,GOCUH7TxHRI
369160,371160,"He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it,",GOCUH7TxHRI
371160,373160,"because now it's dirty, on the ground.",GOCUH7TxHRI
373160,375160,So that's why he's taking the other sandwich.,GOCUH7TxHRI
375160,379160,"Now of course, development doesn't end at five.",GOCUH7TxHRI
379160,381160,And we can see the continuation of this process,GOCUH7TxHRI
381160,383160,of learning to think about other people's thoughts,GOCUH7TxHRI
383160,385160,by upping the ante,GOCUH7TxHRI
385160,388160,"and asking children now, not for an action prediction,",GOCUH7TxHRI
388160,390160,but for a moral judgment.,GOCUH7TxHRI
390160,392160,So first I'm going to show you the three-year-old again.,GOCUH7TxHRI
392160,395160,RS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich?,GOCUH7TxHRI
395160,396160,Child: Yeah.,GOCUH7TxHRI
396160,399160,RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?,GOCUH7TxHRI
399160,401160,Child: Yeah.,GOCUH7TxHRI
401160,403160,So it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan,GOCUH7TxHRI
403160,405160,"to take Joshua's sandwich,",GOCUH7TxHRI
405160,407160,since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich,GOCUH7TxHRI
407160,410160,to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.,GOCUH7TxHRI
410160,412160,But now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.,GOCUH7TxHRI
412160,414160,Remember the five-year-old completely understood,GOCUH7TxHRI
414160,416160,why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich.,GOCUH7TxHRI
416160,418160,RS: Was Ivan being mean and naughty,GOCUH7TxHRI
418160,420160,for taking Joshua's sandwich?,GOCUH7TxHRI
420160,422160,"Child: Um, yeah.",GOCUH7TxHRI
422160,424160,"And so, it is not until age seven",GOCUH7TxHRI
424160,427160,that we get what looks more like an adult response.,GOCUH7TxHRI
427160,430160,RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich?,GOCUH7TxHRI
430160,432160,"Child: No, because the wind should get in trouble.",GOCUH7TxHRI
432160,435160,He says the wind should get in trouble,GOCUH7TxHRI
435160,437160,for switching the sandwiches.,GOCUH7TxHRI
437160,439160,(Laughter),GOCUH7TxHRI
439160,441160,And now what we've started to do in my lab,GOCUH7TxHRI
441160,443160,is to put children into the brain scanner,GOCUH7TxHRI
443160,446160,and ask what's going on in their brain,GOCUH7TxHRI
446160,449160,as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.,GOCUH7TxHRI
449160,453160,"So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ,",GOCUH7TxHRI
453160,456160,being used while children are thinking about other people.,GOCUH7TxHRI
456160,458160,But it's not quite like the adult brain.,GOCUH7TxHRI
458160,460160,"So whereas in the adults, as I told you,",GOCUH7TxHRI
460160,463160,this brain region is almost completely specialized --,GOCUH7TxHRI
463160,466160,it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts --,GOCUH7TxHRI
466160,468160,"in children it's much less so,",GOCUH7TxHRI
468160,470160,"when they are age five to eight,",GOCUH7TxHRI
470160,472160,the age range of the children I just showed you.,GOCUH7TxHRI
472160,475160,"And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds,",GOCUH7TxHRI
475160,477160,"getting into early adolescence,",GOCUH7TxHRI
477160,480160,they still don't have quite an adult-like brain region.,GOCUH7TxHRI
480160,483160,"And so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood",GOCUH7TxHRI
483160,485160,"and even into adolescence,",GOCUH7TxHRI
485160,487160,"both the cognitive system,",GOCUH7TxHRI
487160,489160,"our mind's ability to think about other minds,",GOCUH7TxHRI

498160,500160,people differ from one another in how good they are,GOCUH7TxHRI

502160,504160,and how accurately.,GOCUH7TxHRI
504160,507160,"And so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults",GOCUH7TxHRI
507160,509160,in how they think about other people's thoughts,GOCUH7TxHRI
509160,512160,be explained in terms of differences in this brain region?,GOCUH7TxHRI
512160,515160,"So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version",GOCUH7TxHRI
515160,517160,of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.,GOCUH7TxHRI
517160,519160,And I'm going to give that to you now.,GOCUH7TxHRI
519160,522160,"So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory,",GOCUH7TxHRI
522160,524160,and they take a break for coffee.,GOCUH7TxHRI
524160,527160,And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee.,GOCUH7TxHRI
527160,530160,Grace goes to make the coffee,GOCUH7TxHRI
530160,532160,and finds by the coffee a pot,GOCUH7TxHRI

535160,538160,"But the powder is labeled Deadly Poison,""""",GOCUH7TxHRI
538160,541160,so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.,GOCUH7TxHRI
541160,543160,And she puts it in her friend's coffee.,GOCUH7TxHRI
543160,546160,"And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.",GOCUH7TxHRI
546160,548160,How many people think it was morally permissible,GOCUH7TxHRI
548160,552160,for Grace to put the powder in the coffee?,GOCUH7TxHRI
552160,555160,Okay. Good. (Laughter),GOCUH7TxHRI
555160,558160,"So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed",GOCUH7TxHRI
558160,560160,"in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?",GOCUH7TxHRI
560160,562160,"And we can compare that to another case,",GOCUH7TxHRI
562160,564160,where everything in the real world is the same.,GOCUH7TxHRI
564160,567160,"The powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.",GOCUH7TxHRI
567160,570160,Now she thinks the powder is sugar.,GOCUH7TxHRI

573160,575160,"and puts it in her friend's coffee,",GOCUH7TxHRI
575160,577160,people say she deserves no blame at all.,GOCUH7TxHRI
577160,581160,"Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar,",GOCUH7TxHRI
581160,584160,"now people say she deserves a lot of blame,",GOCUH7TxHRI
584160,587160,even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same.,GOCUH7TxHRI

599160,601160,but actually the powder was poison.,GOCUH7TxHRI
601160,604160,"So even though when the powder was poison,",GOCUH7TxHRI
604160,607160,"the friend drank the coffee and died,",GOCUH7TxHRI
607160,610160,"people say Grace deserves less blame in that case,",GOCUH7TxHRI
610160,612160,"when she innocently thought it was sugar,",GOCUH7TxHRI
612160,614160,"than in the other case, where she thought it was poison",GOCUH7TxHRI
614160,617160,and no harm occurred.,GOCUH7TxHRI
617160,619160,"People, though, disagree a little bit",GOCUH7TxHRI
619160,621160,about exactly how much blame Grace should get,GOCUH7TxHRI
621160,623160,in the accident case.,GOCUH7TxHRI
623160,625160,"Some people think she should deserve more blame,",GOCUH7TxHRI
625160,627160,and other people less.,GOCUH7TxHRI
627160,629160,And what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside,GOCUH7TxHRI
629160,631160,the brains of people while they're making that judgment.,GOCUH7TxHRI
631160,633160,"So what I'm showing you, from left to right,",GOCUH7TxHRI
633160,636160,"is how much activity there was in this brain region,",GOCUH7TxHRI
636160,638160,"and from top to bottom, how much blame",GOCUH7TxHRI
638160,640160,people said that Grace deserved.,GOCUH7TxHRI
640160,642160,"And what you can see is, on the left",GOCUH7TxHRI
642160,644160,"when there was very little activity in this brain region,",GOCUH7TxHRI
644160,647160,people paid little attention to her innocent belief,GOCUH7TxHRI
647160,650160,and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident.,GOCUH7TxHRI
650160,652160,"Whereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity,",GOCUH7TxHRI
652160,655160,"people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief,",GOCUH7TxHRI
655160,657160,and said she deserved a lot less blame,GOCUH7TxHRI
657160,659160,for causing the accident.,GOCUH7TxHRI
659160,661160,"So that's good, but of course",GOCUH7TxHRI
661160,663160,what we'd rather is have a way to interfere,GOCUH7TxHRI
663160,665160,"with function in this brain region,",GOCUH7TxHRI
665160,668160,and see if we could change people's moral judgment.,GOCUH7TxHRI
668160,670160,And we do have such a tool.,GOCUH7TxHRI
670160,672160,"It's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation,",GOCUH7TxHRI
672160,674160,or TMS.,GOCUH7TxHRI
674160,676160,This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse,GOCUH7TxHRI
676160,680160,"through somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain,",GOCUH7TxHRI
680160,684160,and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region.,GOCUH7TxHRI
684160,686160,So I'm going to show you a demo of this.,GOCUH7TxHRI
686160,689160,"First, I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse.",GOCUH7TxHRI
689160,692160,I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine.,GOCUH7TxHRI
692160,696160,"When you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.",GOCUH7TxHRI
702160,705160,"So now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain,",GOCUH7TxHRI
705160,707160,to the part of my brain that controls my hand.,GOCUH7TxHRI
707160,710160,"So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse.",GOCUH7TxHRI
714160,716160,"Woman (Video): Ready, Rebecca? RS: Yes.",GOCUH7TxHRI
717160,720160,"Okay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand",GOCUH7TxHRI
720160,723160,by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain.,GOCUH7TxHRI
723160,725160,"And we can use that same pulse,",GOCUH7TxHRI
725160,727160,"now applied to the RTPJ,",GOCUH7TxHRI
727160,730160,to ask if we can change people's moral judgments.,GOCUH7TxHRI
730160,732160,"So these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments.",GOCUH7TxHRI
732160,735160,And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ,GOCUH7TxHRI
735160,737160,and ask how people's judgments change.,GOCUH7TxHRI
737160,741160,"And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall.",GOCUH7TxHRI
741160,743160,So their judgments of the case when everything was fine,GOCUH7TxHRI
743160,746160,remain the same. They say she deserves no blame.,GOCUH7TxHRI
746160,750160,"But in the case of a failed attempt to harm,",GOCUH7TxHRI
750160,753160,"where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar,",GOCUH7TxHRI
753160,756160,"people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame",GOCUH7TxHRI
756160,759160,for putting the powder in the coffee.,GOCUH7TxHRI
759160,761160,"And in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar,",GOCUH7TxHRI
761160,764160,"but it was really poison and so she caused a death,",GOCUH7TxHRI
764160,770160,"people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame.",GOCUH7TxHRI
770160,772160,So what I've told you today is that,GOCUH7TxHRI
772160,776160,"people come, actually, especially well equipped",GOCUH7TxHRI
776160,778160,to think about other people's thoughts.,GOCUH7TxHRI
778160,780160,We have a special brain system,GOCUH7TxHRI
780160,783160,that lets us think about what other people are thinking.,GOCUH7TxHRI
783160,785160,"This system takes a long time to develop,",GOCUH7TxHRI
785160,788160,slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.,GOCUH7TxHRI
788160,791160,"And even in adulthood, differences in this brain region",GOCUH7TxHRI
791160,793160,can explain differences among adults,GOCUH7TxHRI
793160,796160,in how we think about and judge other people.,GOCUH7TxHRI
796160,799160,"But I want to give the last word back to the novelists,",GOCUH7TxHRI

569260,571260,is that the future,M1o3FS0awtk
571260,573260,"might not be North American,",M1o3FS0awtk
573260,575260,might not be Western European.,M1o3FS0awtk
575260,578260,It might be Latin American.,M1o3FS0awtk
578260,580260,"And the challenge, really,",M1o3FS0awtk
580260,583260,is to pull the global average up here.,M1o3FS0awtk
583260,585260,That's what we need to do.,M1o3FS0awtk
585260,587260,"And if we're going to do that,",M1o3FS0awtk
587260,590260,"we need to pull countries from the bottom,",M1o3FS0awtk
590260,593260,and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.,M1o3FS0awtk
593260,596260,And then we're starting to create a happy planet.,M1o3FS0awtk
596260,598260,That's one way of looking at it.,M1o3FS0awtk
598260,600260,Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends.,M1o3FS0awtk
600260,603260,"We don't have good data going back for every country in the world,",M1o3FS0awtk
603260,606260,"but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.",M1o3FS0awtk
606260,609260,"And this is the trend in well-being over that time,",M1o3FS0awtk
609260,611260,"a small increase,",M1o3FS0awtk
611260,613260,but this is the trend in ecological footprint.,M1o3FS0awtk
613260,616260,"And so in strict happy-planet methodology,",M1o3FS0awtk
616260,618260,we've become less efficient,M1o3FS0awtk
618260,620260,at turning our ultimate scarce resource,M1o3FS0awtk
620260,623260,into the outcome we want to.,M1o3FS0awtk
623260,626260,"And the point really is, is that I think,",M1o3FS0awtk
626260,628260,probably everybody in this room,M1o3FS0awtk
628260,630260,would like society to get to 2050,M1o3FS0awtk
630260,633260,without an apocalyptic,M1o3FS0awtk
633260,635260,something happening.,M1o3FS0awtk
635260,637260,It's actually not very long away.,M1o3FS0awtk
637260,639260,It's half a human lifetime away.,M1o3FS0awtk
639260,641260,A child entering school today,M1o3FS0awtk
641260,643260,will be my age in 2050.,M1o3FS0awtk
643260,646260,This is not the very distant future.,M1o3FS0awtk
646260,649260,This is what the U.K. government target,M1o3FS0awtk
649260,652260,on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.,M1o3FS0awtk
653260,656260,"And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.",M1o3FS0awtk

673260,675260,"None of us, I think,",M1o3FS0awtk
675260,677260,want human progress to stop.,M1o3FS0awtk
677260,679260,I think we want it to carry on.,M1o3FS0awtk
679260,681260,I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.,M1o3FS0awtk

690260,692260,"And if we're going to engage them,",M1o3FS0awtk
692260,694260,I think that's what we've got to do.,M1o3FS0awtk

697260,700260,"Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that,",M1o3FS0awtk
700260,703260,but the point is we need to turn those curves.,M1o3FS0awtk

800260,803260,everything evidence based -- a huge tome.,M1o3FS0awtk

806260,808260,to improve well-being in your life?,M1o3FS0awtk

810260,812260,"they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness,",M1o3FS0awtk
812260,815260,but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.,M1o3FS0awtk
815260,818260,"And the first of these is to connect,",M1o3FS0awtk
818260,820260,is that your social relationships,M1o3FS0awtk

831260,834260,The fastest way out of a bad mood:,M1o3FS0awtk
834260,837260,"step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.",M1o3FS0awtk
837260,840260,Being active is great for our positive mood.,M1o3FS0awtk

896260,898260,We feel good if we give.,M1o3FS0awtk
898260,900260,You can do an experiment where you give,M1o3FS0awtk
900260,903260,two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.,M1o3FS0awtk
903260,906260,You tell one of them to spend it on themselves,M1o3FS0awtk
906260,908260,and one on other people.,M1o3FS0awtk
908260,910260,"You measure their happiness at the end of the day,",M1o3FS0awtk
910260,912260,those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier,M1o3FS0awtk
912260,915260,that those that spent it on themselves.,M1o3FS0awtk
915260,917260,"And these five ways,",M1o3FS0awtk
917260,920260,"which we put onto these handy postcards,",M1o3FS0awtk

925260,928260,They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.,M1o3FS0awtk

958260,961260,"needs to go to the top of the mountain top,",M1o3FS0awtk
961260,963260,"and it needs to look out,",M1o3FS0awtk

988260,990260,something like the Happy Planet Index.,M1o3FS0awtk
990260,992260,And then I believe,M1o3FS0awtk
992260,994260,"that we can all create a world we all want,",M1o3FS0awtk

58330,61330,"From regular, relative skydiving",eXp5QSfXLQU

162330,165330,"meaning mountains, cliffs.",eXp5QSfXLQU
165330,168330,It's for sure -- for me -- it's the ultimate feeling,eXp5QSfXLQU

172330,175330,with all the visual references.,eXp5QSfXLQU

178330,181330,that nobody had jumped before.,eXp5QSfXLQU
181330,183330,So in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump,eXp5QSfXLQU

225330,229330,wanted to get into stunts.,eXp5QSfXLQU
229330,232330,"So with some friends we started to do different tricks,",eXp5QSfXLQU
232330,234330,"like for example this jump here,",eXp5QSfXLQU
234330,236330,I jumped from a paraglider.,eXp5QSfXLQU
236330,242330,"Or here -- everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me,",eXp5QSfXLQU
242330,244330,because it was very cold in Austria,eXp5QSfXLQU

279330,284330,"Of course you need to be in physical, very good, condition,",eXp5QSfXLQU
284330,286330,so I'm training a lot.,eXp5QSfXLQU
286330,290330,You need to have the best possible equipment.,eXp5QSfXLQU
290330,294330,And probably the most important is,eXp5QSfXLQU
294330,297330,"you have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.",eXp5QSfXLQU
297330,301330,And all this to come as close as possible,eXp5QSfXLQU

591330,594330,June Cohen: I have some questions.,eXp5QSfXLQU
594330,596330,I think we all might have some questions.,eXp5QSfXLQU
596330,598330,Question one: so does that actually feel,eXp5QSfXLQU
598330,600330,the way the flying dream does?,eXp5QSfXLQU
600330,602330,Because it looks like it might.,eXp5QSfXLQU
602330,605330,Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest,eXp5QSfXLQU
605330,609330,possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly.,eXp5QSfXLQU
609330,612330,"JC: I know the answer to this, but how do you land?",eXp5QSfXLQU
612330,615330,UE: Parachute. We have to open a parachute,eXp5QSfXLQU
615330,620330,"just seconds before, I would say, impact.",eXp5QSfXLQU
620330,622330,(Laughter),eXp5QSfXLQU
622330,625330,It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.,eXp5QSfXLQU
625330,627330,JC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those --,eXp5QSfXLQU
627330,630330,you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it?,eXp5QSfXLQU
630330,632330,UE: It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah.,eXp5QSfXLQU
632330,634330,We're still working on it and we're,eXp5QSfXLQU
634330,637330,"developing the wingsuits to get better performance,",eXp5QSfXLQU
637330,639330,to get more knowledge.,eXp5QSfXLQU
639330,641330,And I believe soon.,eXp5QSfXLQU
641330,643330,JC: All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions.,eXp5QSfXLQU
643330,645330,What is the -- there was exhaust coming,eXp5QSfXLQU
645330,648330,out of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing?,eXp5QSfXLQU
648330,650330,UE: Nope. It's just smoke.,eXp5QSfXLQU
650330,651330,JC: Coming off of you?,eXp5QSfXLQU
651330,652330,(Laughter),eXp5QSfXLQU
652330,654330,UE: Hopefully not.,eXp5QSfXLQU
654330,655330,(Laughter),eXp5QSfXLQU
655330,656330,JC: That seems dangerous.,eXp5QSfXLQU
656330,658330,"UE: No, smoke is for two reasons,",eXp5QSfXLQU
658330,662330,"you can see the speed, you can see the way",eXp5QSfXLQU
662330,664330,where I was flying.,eXp5QSfXLQU
664330,666330,That's reason number one. And reason number two:,eXp5QSfXLQU
666330,669330,it's much easier for the camera guy to film,eXp5QSfXLQU
669330,671330,If I'm using smoke.,eXp5QSfXLQU
671330,673330,"JC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke",eXp5QSfXLQU
673330,675330,so that you can be tracked. One more question.,eXp5QSfXLQU
675330,677330,What do you do to to cover your face?,eXp5QSfXLQU
677330,679330,Because I just keep thinking of going that fast,eXp5QSfXLQU
679330,681330,and having your whole face smushed backwards.,eXp5QSfXLQU
681330,685330,Are you in a helmet? Are you in goggles?,eXp5QSfXLQU
685330,688330,UE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles.,eXp5QSfXLQU
688330,691330,JC: And is that how you usually fly?,eXp5QSfXLQU
691330,694330,UE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet,eXp5QSfXLQU
694330,696330,because of landings -- usually it's difficult --,eXp5QSfXLQU
696330,700330,it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.,eXp5QSfXLQU
700330,702330,So you have to be prepared.,eXp5QSfXLQU
702330,704330,JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do?,eXp5QSfXLQU
704330,707330,"Do people come to you with projects and say, We want you to do this!""""",eXp5QSfXLQU
707330,709330,"and do you ever say, No, no I'm not going to.""""",eXp5QSfXLQU
709330,711330,"UE: Oh of course, of course. Some people have crazy ideas and --",eXp5QSfXLQU
711330,715330,(Laughter),eXp5QSfXLQU
715330,718330,JC: ...a round of applause...,eXp5QSfXLQU
718330,720330,(Applause),eXp5QSfXLQU

12160,15160,There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.,JNcLKbJs3xk
16160,18160,So let's start talking about that.,JNcLKbJs3xk
18160,21160,I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.,JNcLKbJs3xk
21160,24160,That's what I have behind myself.,JNcLKbJs3xk
24160,27160,(Laughter),JNcLKbJs3xk
27160,30160,But of course what we have to remember is this.,JNcLKbJs3xk
30160,33160,"And what you have to think about is,",JNcLKbJs3xk
33160,36160,"when you're dancing in the flames, what's next?",JNcLKbJs3xk
36160,39160,So what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes,JNcLKbJs3xk
39160,41160,is I'm going to talk first about the flames --,JNcLKbJs3xk
41160,43160,where we are in the economy --,JNcLKbJs3xk
43160,45160,and then I'm going to take three trends,JNcLKbJs3xk
45160,48160,that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years,JNcLKbJs3xk
48160,50160,and that will take place in this conference,JNcLKbJs3xk
50160,53160,and I will try and bring them together.,JNcLKbJs3xk
53160,57160,And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.,JNcLKbJs3xk
57160,59160,Those three trends are,JNcLKbJs3xk
59160,61160,"the ability to engineer cells,",JNcLKbJs3xk
61160,63160,"the ability to engineer tissues,",JNcLKbJs3xk
63160,65160,and robots.,JNcLKbJs3xk
65160,67160,And somehow it will all make sense.,JNcLKbJs3xk
67160,70160,"But anyway, let's start with the economy.",JNcLKbJs3xk
70160,73160,There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.,JNcLKbJs3xk
73160,75160,One is leverage.,JNcLKbJs3xk
75160,77160,And the problem with leverage is,JNcLKbJs3xk
77160,80160,it makes the U.S. financial system look like this.,JNcLKbJs3xk
80160,83160,(Laughter),JNcLKbJs3xk
87160,90160,"So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.",JNcLKbJs3xk
90160,93160,"That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.",JNcLKbJs3xk
93160,96160,"A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,",JNcLKbJs3xk
96160,98160,it's an investment bank;,JNcLKbJs3xk
98160,100160,it has 15 to 20 times.,JNcLKbJs3xk
100160,103160,It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.,JNcLKbJs3xk
103160,106160,And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.,JNcLKbJs3xk
106160,108160,Oops.,JNcLKbJs3xk
108160,112160,That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.,JNcLKbJs3xk
112160,115160,"And that, of course, is the reason why all of you",JNcLKbJs3xk
115160,118160,are making such generous and wonderful donations,JNcLKbJs3xk
118160,120160,to these nice folks.,JNcLKbJs3xk
123160,125160,"And as you think about that,",JNcLKbJs3xk
125160,128160,you've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?,JNcLKbJs3xk
131160,134160,(Laughter),JNcLKbJs3xk
140160,142160,It ain't pretty.,JNcLKbJs3xk
143160,147160,"The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.",JNcLKbJs3xk
147160,150160,"We all love Santa Claus, right?",JNcLKbJs3xk
150160,153160,"But the problem with Santa Clause is,",JNcLKbJs3xk
153160,156160,if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing,JNcLKbJs3xk
156160,158160,"and promising folks,",JNcLKbJs3xk
158160,163160,"it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending",JNcLKbJs3xk
163160,166160,"on what we call entitlements.""""",JNcLKbJs3xk
166160,169160,And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.,JNcLKbJs3xk
169160,173160,And we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.,JNcLKbJs3xk
174160,177160,"Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,",JNcLKbJs3xk
177160,180160,that we've brought that date of reckoning forward,JNcLKbJs3xk
180160,183160,to about 2017.,JNcLKbJs3xk
183160,186160,"And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,",JNcLKbJs3xk
186160,188160,"but, guess what?",JNcLKbJs3xk
188160,190160,We're going to start to pay them.,JNcLKbJs3xk
190160,192160,"And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due,",JNcLKbJs3xk
192160,196160,it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.,JNcLKbJs3xk
196160,198160,Right?,JNcLKbJs3xk
198160,201160,(Laughter),JNcLKbJs3xk
210160,214160,Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.,JNcLKbJs3xk
214160,217160,This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.,JNcLKbJs3xk
217160,220160,He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.,JNcLKbJs3xk
220160,223160,And he gave an interview in December.,JNcLKbJs3xk
223160,225160,Here's his first bit of advice.,JNcLKbJs3xk
225160,228160,And here's his second bit of advice.,JNcLKbJs3xk
230160,232160,"And, by the way,",JNcLKbJs3xk
232160,235160,the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.,JNcLKbJs3xk
235160,237160,This stuff is getting serious enough,JNcLKbJs3xk
237160,239160,"that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,",JNcLKbJs3xk
239160,242160,we're going to end up losing the dollar.,JNcLKbJs3xk
242160,245160,And then all bets are off.,JNcLKbJs3xk
245160,248160,Let me show you what it looks like.,JNcLKbJs3xk
248160,250160,I think I can safely say,JNcLKbJs3xk
250160,253160,that I'm the only trillionaire in this room.,JNcLKbJs3xk
254160,256160,This is an actual bill.,JNcLKbJs3xk
256160,259160,And it's 10 triliion dollars.,JNcLKbJs3xk
259160,262160,The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.,JNcLKbJs3xk
262160,265160,"That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,",JNcLKbJs3xk
265160,267160,a buck next week.,JNcLKbJs3xk
267160,271160,And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.,JNcLKbJs3xk
272160,277160,"So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,",JNcLKbJs3xk
277160,284160,and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want --,JNcLKbJs3xk
284160,286160,you've just got to say no.,JNcLKbJs3xk
286160,290160,"And you've got to start banishing a word that's called entitlement.""""",JNcLKbJs3xk
290160,293160,And the reason we have to do that in the short term,JNcLKbJs3xk
293160,296160,is because we have just run out of cash.,JNcLKbJs3xk
296160,299160,"If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.",JNcLKbJs3xk
299160,302160,The orange slice is what's discretionary.,JNcLKbJs3xk
302160,304160,Everything else is mandated.,JNcLKbJs3xk
305160,308160,It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.,JNcLKbJs3xk
308160,311160,So what we have to start thinking about doing,JNcLKbJs3xk
311160,313160,is capping our medical spending,JNcLKbJs3xk
313160,316160,because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.,JNcLKbJs3xk
316160,319160,We've got to start thinking about asking people,JNcLKbJs3xk
319160,321160,to retire a little bit later.,JNcLKbJs3xk
322160,325160,If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.,JNcLKbJs3xk
325160,327160,Your 401(k) just got nailed.,JNcLKbJs3xk
327160,330160,If you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.,JNcLKbJs3xk
330160,333160,If you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.,JNcLKbJs3xk
333160,336160,"The reason why that's reasonable is,",JNcLKbJs3xk
336160,338160,"when your grandparents were given Social Security,",JNcLKbJs3xk
338160,341160,they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.,JNcLKbJs3xk
341160,344160,Sixty-eight is young today.,JNcLKbJs3xk
344160,348160,We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year.,JNcLKbJs3xk
348160,350160,We've got to limit other mandatory spending.,JNcLKbJs3xk
350160,353160,"We've got to quit borrowing as much,",JNcLKbJs3xk
353160,356160,because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.,JNcLKbJs3xk
356160,358160,And we've got to end up with a smaller government.,JNcLKbJs3xk
358160,361160,"And if we don't start changing this trend line,",JNcLKbJs3xk
361160,363160,we are going to lose the dollar,JNcLKbJs3xk
363160,365160,and start to look like Iceland.,JNcLKbJs3xk
365160,368160,I got what you're thinking.,JNcLKbJs3xk
368160,372160,This is going to happen when hell freezes over.,JNcLKbJs3xk
373160,376160,But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas.,JNcLKbJs3xk
378160,381160,(Laughter),JNcLKbJs3xk
383160,386160,Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff.,JNcLKbJs3xk
386160,389160,"So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis",JNcLKbJs3xk
389160,391160,back in the late '80s.,JNcLKbJs3xk
391160,394160,And its 225 largest companies today,JNcLKbJs3xk
394160,397160,are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.,JNcLKbJs3xk
397160,399160,"We don't fix this now,",JNcLKbJs3xk
399160,402160,"how would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?",JNcLKbJs3xk
402160,405160,Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.,JNcLKbJs3xk
405160,408160,And unless you want this person,JNcLKbJs3xk
408160,411160,"to not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,",JNcLKbJs3xk
411160,414160,we'd better deal with this stuff.,JNcLKbJs3xk
414160,417160,That's the short term. That's the flame part.,JNcLKbJs3xk
417160,419160,That's the financial crisis.,JNcLKbJs3xk
419160,423160,"Now, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave",JNcLKbJs3xk
423160,424160,that we need to talk about.,JNcLKbJs3xk
424160,426160,"That wave is much larger, much more powerful,",JNcLKbJs3xk
426160,429160,and that's of course the wave of technology.,JNcLKbJs3xk
429160,431160,"And what's really important in this stuff is,",JNcLKbJs3xk
431160,433160,"as we cut, we also have to grow.",JNcLKbJs3xk
433160,436160,"Among other things, because startup companies",JNcLKbJs3xk
436160,438160,are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm,JNcLKbJs3xk
438160,441160,and they're about 17.8 percent of output.,JNcLKbJs3xk
443160,446160,It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.,JNcLKbJs3xk
446160,448160,And that's what we've got to keep growing.,JNcLKbJs3xk
448160,451160,We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.,JNcLKbJs3xk
452160,456160,So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.,JNcLKbJs3xk
458160,463160,And that's where these three trends come together.,JNcLKbJs3xk
463160,466160,"That's where the ability to engineer microbes,",JNcLKbJs3xk
466160,468160,"the ability to engineer tissues,",JNcLKbJs3xk
468160,470160,and the ability to engineer robots,JNcLKbJs3xk
470160,472160,begin to lead to a reboot.,JNcLKbJs3xk
472160,474160,And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.,JNcLKbJs3xk
474160,476160,Craig Venter showed up last year,JNcLKbJs3xk
476160,478160,and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware,JNcLKbJs3xk
478160,481160,where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.,JNcLKbJs3xk
481160,484160,"In parallel, the folks at MIT",JNcLKbJs3xk
484160,487160,have been building a standard registry of biological parts.,JNcLKbJs3xk
487160,490160,So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.,JNcLKbJs3xk
490160,493160,"You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.",JNcLKbJs3xk
493160,496160,And start building stuff.,JNcLKbJs3xk
496160,499160,In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students,JNcLKbJs3xk
499160,501160,and started to build these little odd creatures.,JNcLKbJs3xk
501160,504160,They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.,JNcLKbJs3xk
504160,507160,Here was one of the first things they built.,JNcLKbJs3xk
507160,509160,"So, cells have this cycle.",JNcLKbJs3xk
509160,511160,First they don't grow.,JNcLKbJs3xk
511160,513160,Then they grow exponentially.,JNcLKbJs3xk
513160,515160,Then they stop growing.,JNcLKbJs3xk
515160,518160,Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.,JNcLKbJs3xk
518160,520160,So they engineered these cells,JNcLKbJs3xk
520160,522160,"so that when they're growing in the exponential phase,",JNcLKbJs3xk
522160,524160,they would smell like wintergreen.,JNcLKbJs3xk
524160,527160,And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.,JNcLKbJs3xk
527160,530160,And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working,JNcLKbJs3xk
530160,533160,"and wasn't, and where it was in the phase.",JNcLKbJs3xk
533160,536160,This got a bit more complicated two years later.,JNcLKbJs3xk
536160,538160,Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.,JNcLKbJs3xk
538160,540160,They started competing.,JNcLKbJs3xk
540160,545160,The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine,JNcLKbJs3xk
545160,547160,that makes red wine good for you,JNcLKbJs3xk

1040160,1043160,"And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,",JNcLKbJs3xk
1043160,1046160,"and then you got life about four billion years ago,",JNcLKbJs3xk
1046160,1050160,"and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,",JNcLKbJs3xk
1050160,1055160,and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.,JNcLKbJs3xk

1057160,1059160,"Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,",JNcLKbJs3xk

1062160,1064160,"and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff",JNcLKbJs3xk
1064160,1068160,is to create what's in this room.,JNcLKbJs3xk
1068160,1070160,Maybe not.,JNcLKbJs3xk

1084160,1088160,(Laughter),JNcLKbJs3xk
1088160,1092160,I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.,JNcLKbJs3xk
1093160,1097160,I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.,JNcLKbJs3xk

1102160,1104160,and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.,JNcLKbJs3xk
1104160,1107160,And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends,JNcLKbJs3xk
1107160,1110160,into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control,JNcLKbJs3xk

149273,152952,"And if you move in time
from 20,000 years ago to the modern day,",6MgDcFlTgVM
152976,154785,you see that temperature increased.,6MgDcFlTgVM
154809,156434,It didn't increase smoothly.,6MgDcFlTgVM
156458,158236,"Sometimes it increased very rapidly,",6MgDcFlTgVM
158260,159504,"then there was a plateau,",6MgDcFlTgVM

160817,162841,"It was different in the two polar regions,",6MgDcFlTgVM
162865,165594,and CO2 also increased in jumps.,6MgDcFlTgVM

what's going on down in the deep sea,",6MgDcFlTgVM

to charter a research boat.",6MgDcFlTgVM

are as big as Everest.",6MgDcFlTgVM

290650,292642,"we get about 100-meter resolution,",6MgDcFlTgVM
292666,295555,"enough to pick out areas

sea monster started rolling past.",6MgDcFlTgVM
365802,368908,"It's called a pyrosome

385180,388291,"An organism like this probably lives
for about a hundred years.",6MgDcFlTgVM
388315,391855,"And as it grows, it takes in
chemicals from the ocean.",6MgDcFlTgVM
391879,394085,"And the chemicals,
or the amount of chemicals,",6MgDcFlTgVM
394109,396783,"depends on the temperature;
it depends on the pH,",6MgDcFlTgVM
396807,398353,it depends on the nutrients.,6MgDcFlTgVM
398377,401611,"And if we can understand how
these chemicals get into the skeleton,",6MgDcFlTgVM
401635,404133,"we can then go back,
collect fossil specimens,",6MgDcFlTgVM
404157,407301,"and reconstruct what the ocean
used to look like in the past.",6MgDcFlTgVM
407325,410761,"And here you can see us collecting
that coral with a vacuum system,",6MgDcFlTgVM

carefully, I should add.",6MgDcFlTgVM

across this coral --",6MgDcFlTgVM
435278,437084,you can see the marks --,6MgDcFlTgVM
437108,440067,"and he's been able to show
that these are actual annual bands,",6MgDcFlTgVM

442028,444796,"corals can record seasonal changes,",6MgDcFlTgVM
444820,446552,which is pretty spectacular.,6MgDcFlTgVM
446576,450374,"But 4,000 years is not enough to get
us back to our last glacial maximum.",6MgDcFlTgVM
450398,451556,So what do we do?,6MgDcFlTgVM

454180,457111,"This is what makes me really unpopular
with my research team.",6MgDcFlTgVM

there are swimming holothurians,",6MgDcFlTgVM
462473,463744,"there's giant sponges,",6MgDcFlTgVM
463768,466363,"but I make everyone go down
to these dead fossil areas",6MgDcFlTgVM
466387,469943,"and spend ages kind of shoveling
around on the seafloor.",6MgDcFlTgVM
469967,473332,"And we pick up all these corals,
bring them back, we sort them out.",6MgDcFlTgVM
473356,475651,"But each one of these is a different age,",6MgDcFlTgVM

477600,480112,"and then we can measure
those chemical signals,",6MgDcFlTgVM

polished it very carefully",6MgDcFlTgVM

we've made in the corals,",6MgDcFlTgVM
604278,607364,"that the deep part of the Southern Ocean
was very rich in carbon,",6MgDcFlTgVM

partway through that climate transition.",6MgDcFlTgVM
620972,623439,"That allows carbon to come
out of the deep ocean.",6MgDcFlTgVM
624154,627253,"And then if we analyze corals
closer to the modern day,",6MgDcFlTgVM
627277,629531,or indeed if we go down there today anyway,6MgDcFlTgVM
629555,631761,"and measure the chemistry of the corals,",6MgDcFlTgVM
631785,635779,"we see that we move to a position
where carbon can exchange in and out.",6MgDcFlTgVM

28808,30845,"Now, it's no secret, because I like collecting things,",i63jTStjZSQ
30845,32781,that I love the Natural History Museum,i63jTStjZSQ

34181,35996,at the Natural History Museum in dioramas.,i63jTStjZSQ
35996,38133,"These, to me, are like living sculptures, right,",i63jTStjZSQ
38133,39550,"that you can go and look at,",i63jTStjZSQ

41285,42932,in this animal's life.,i63jTStjZSQ
42932,44814,"So I was thinking about my own life,",i63jTStjZSQ

46727,49510,"for the ages, and also — (Laughter) —",i63jTStjZSQ
49510,51997,"the lives of my friends, but",i63jTStjZSQ
51997,54613,the problem with this is that my friends aren't quite keen,i63jTStjZSQ
54613,57789,on the idea of me taxidermy-ing them. (Laughter),i63jTStjZSQ
57789,60492,"So instead, I turned to video,",i63jTStjZSQ
60492,62790,and video is the next best way to preserve and memorialize,i63jTStjZSQ
62790,65564,someone and to capture a specific moment in time.,i63jTStjZSQ
65564,67741,"So what I did was, I filmed six of my friends",i63jTStjZSQ
67741,70141,"and then, using video mapping and video projection,",i63jTStjZSQ
70141,72622,"I created a video sculpture, which was these six friends",i63jTStjZSQ
72622,76564,projected into jars. (Laughter),i63jTStjZSQ

93277,95370,"So, this is interesting to me,",i63jTStjZSQ
95370,99260,but it lacked a certain human element. (Laughter),i63jTStjZSQ
99260,101082,"It's a digital sculpture, so I wanted to add",i63jTStjZSQ
101082,102694,"an interaction system. So what I did was,",i63jTStjZSQ
102694,104477,"I added a proximity sensor, so that when you get close",i63jTStjZSQ
104477,106636,"to the people in jars, they react to you in different ways.",i63jTStjZSQ
106636,108363,"You know, just like people on the street",i63jTStjZSQ
108363,110219,when you get too close to them.,i63jTStjZSQ
110219,112805,Some people reacted in terror. (Laughter),i63jTStjZSQ
112805,114818,"Others reacted in asking you for help,",i63jTStjZSQ
114818,118316,and some people hide from you.,i63jTStjZSQ
118316,119947,"So this was really interesting to me, this idea of",i63jTStjZSQ
119947,122082,"taking video off the screen and putting it in real life,",i63jTStjZSQ
122082,124329,and also adding interactivity to sculpture.,i63jTStjZSQ
124329,128394,"So over the next year, I documented 40 of my other friends",i63jTStjZSQ
128394,130226,and trapped them in jars as well,i63jTStjZSQ
130226,132171,"and created a piece known as Garden,",i63jTStjZSQ
132171,134523,which is literally a garden of humanity.,i63jTStjZSQ
134523,136667,"But something about the first piece,",i63jTStjZSQ
136667,138572,"the Animali Chordata piece, kept coming back to me,",i63jTStjZSQ
138572,140393,"this idea of interaction with art,",i63jTStjZSQ
140393,142715,"and I really liked the idea of people being able to interact,",i63jTStjZSQ
142715,145004,and also being challenged by interacting with art.,i63jTStjZSQ
145004,146859,So I wanted to create a new piece that actually,i63jTStjZSQ
146859,148748,"forced people to come and interact with something,",i63jTStjZSQ
148748,150447,and the way I did this was actually by projecting,i63jTStjZSQ
150447,154827,a 1950s housewife into a blender. (Laughter),i63jTStjZSQ
154827,157322,"This is a piece called Blend, and what it does is",i63jTStjZSQ
157322,159185,it actually makes you implicit in the work of art.,i63jTStjZSQ
159185,161526,You may never experience the entire thing yourself.,i63jTStjZSQ
161526,163850,"You can walk away, you can just watch as this character",i63jTStjZSQ
163850,166275,"stands there in the blender and looks at you,",i63jTStjZSQ
166275,168349,or you can actually choose to interact with it.,i63jTStjZSQ
168349,172482,"So if you do choose to interact with the piece,",i63jTStjZSQ
172482,174642,"and you press the blender button, it actually sends",i63jTStjZSQ
174642,178074,this character into this dizzying disarray of dishevelment.,i63jTStjZSQ
178074,181626,"By doing that, you are now part of my piece.",i63jTStjZSQ
181626,183658,"You, like the people that are trapped in my work",i63jTStjZSQ
183658,187719,"— (Blender noises, laughter) —",i63jTStjZSQ
187719,194826,have become part of my work as well. (Laughter),i63jTStjZSQ
194826,197019,(Laughter),i63jTStjZSQ
197019,199442,(Applause),i63jTStjZSQ
199442,203082,"But, but this seems a bit unfair, right?",i63jTStjZSQ
203082,205594,"I put my friends in jars, I put this character,",i63jTStjZSQ
205594,208411,this sort of endangered species character in a blender.,i63jTStjZSQ
208411,210411,But I'd never done anything about myself.,i63jTStjZSQ
210411,212123,I'd never really memorialized myself.,i63jTStjZSQ
212123,214393,So I decided to create a piece which is a self-portrait piece.,i63jTStjZSQ
214393,216618,This is sort of a self-portrait taxidermy time capsule piece,i63jTStjZSQ
216618,218865,"called A Point Just Passed,",i63jTStjZSQ
218865,221497,"in which I project myself on top of a time card punch clock,",i63jTStjZSQ
221497,223201,and it's up to you.,i63jTStjZSQ
223201,225147,"If you want to choose to punch that punch card clock,",i63jTStjZSQ
225147,226854,you actually age me.,i63jTStjZSQ
226854,229410,"So I start as a baby, and then if you punch the clock,",i63jTStjZSQ
229410,234072,"you'll actually transform the baby into a toddler,",i63jTStjZSQ
234072,237303,and then from a toddler I'm transformed into a teenager.,i63jTStjZSQ
237303,239823,"From a teenager, I'm transformed into my current self.",i63jTStjZSQ
239823,242911,"From my current self, I'm turned into a middle-aged man,",i63jTStjZSQ
242911,246770,"and then, from there, into an elderly man.",i63jTStjZSQ
246770,249702,And if you punch the punch card clock a hundred times,i63jTStjZSQ
249702,252773,"in one day, the piece goes black",i63jTStjZSQ
252773,255466,and is not to be reset until the next day.,i63jTStjZSQ
255466,257550,"So, in doing so, you're erasing time.",i63jTStjZSQ
257550,259478,You're actually implicit in this work,i63jTStjZSQ
259478,261484,and you're erasing my life.,i63jTStjZSQ
261484,263630,"So I like this about interactive video sculpture,",i63jTStjZSQ
263630,265207,"that you can actually interact with it,",i63jTStjZSQ
265207,267079,that all of you can actually touch an artwork,i63jTStjZSQ
267079,268943,"and be part of the artwork yourselves,",i63jTStjZSQ
268943,271414,"and hopefully, one day, I'll have each and every one of you",i63jTStjZSQ
271414,273574,trapped in one of my jars. (Laughter),i63jTStjZSQ

635182,637484,"where I was looking, or where we were looking,",luoKOkTxOtU
637484,639902,and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow,luoKOkTxOtU

649444,652511,exactly the moment that I stopped looking at them,luoKOkTxOtU

664314,666467,And so I'll just show it one more time.,luoKOkTxOtU
666467,669664,(Music) And it's literally done by using what our brains,luoKOkTxOtU
669664,673399,"naturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shift",luoKOkTxOtU
673399,675351,"your attention, something changes, and then I left",luoKOkTxOtU

724719,729583,"move this train, because it fits so snugly into our set.",luoKOkTxOtU

732046,735729,"used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein,",luoKOkTxOtU

741672,744271,"and what is moving appears to be stopped,",luoKOkTxOtU
744271,747186,so what you're actually seeing now is the train is not,luoKOkTxOtU
747186,752266,"moving at all, and what is actually moving is the floor.",luoKOkTxOtU

28260,31260,I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.,k7sKMj85hDw
31260,34260,I started a site called TreeHugger --,k7sKMj85hDw
36260,39260,I care about this stuff.,k7sKMj85hDw
39260,41260,I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day,k7sKMj85hDw
41260,44260,can increase my risk of dying by a third.,k7sKMj85hDw
45260,48260,Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion,k7sKMj85hDw
48260,51260,animals we raise each year for meat,k7sKMj85hDw
51260,54260,are raised in factory farm conditions,k7sKMj85hDw
54260,57260,"that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider",k7sKMj85hDw

68260,71260,"cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it.",k7sKMj85hDw
72260,75260,And beef production uses 100 times the water,k7sKMj85hDw
75260,78260,that most vegetables do.,k7sKMj85hDw
80260,83260,I also knew that I'm not alone.,k7sKMj85hDw
83260,85260,We as a society,k7sKMj85hDw
85260,87260,are eating twice as much meat,k7sKMj85hDw
87260,89260,as we did in the 50s.,k7sKMj85hDw
90260,93260,So what was once the special little side treat,k7sKMj85hDw
93260,95260,"now is the main, much more regular.",k7sKMj85hDw
95260,97260,"So really, any of these angles",k7sKMj85hDw
97260,100260,should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian.,k7sKMj85hDw

102260,105260,tucking into a big old steak.,k7sKMj85hDw
105260,108260,So why was I stalling?,k7sKMj85hDw
108260,110260,I realized that what I was being pitched,k7sKMj85hDw
110260,112260,was a binary solution.,k7sKMj85hDw

114260,117260,"you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian,",k7sKMj85hDw
117260,120260,and I guess I just wasn't quite ready.,k7sKMj85hDw

123260,127260,(Laughter),k7sKMj85hDw

151260,154260,"I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.",k7sKMj85hDw
154260,157260,It's called weekday veg.,k7sKMj85hDw

171260,174260,in terms of environmental damage and health,k7sKMj85hDw
174260,176260,are red and processed meats.,k7sKMj85hDw

178260,181260,"with some good, sustainably harvested fish.",k7sKMj85hDw
181260,183260,"It's structured,",k7sKMj85hDw
183260,185260,"so it ends up being simple to remember,",k7sKMj85hDw
185260,188260,and it's okay to break it here and there.,k7sKMj85hDw
188260,190260,"After all, cutting five days a week",k7sKMj85hDw
190260,193260,is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake.,k7sKMj85hDw

48726.0,51290.0,"and actually having fully

a little bit about the problem.",tiwVMrTLUWg

72172.0,74200.0,"To put that in perspective,",tiwVMrTLUWg

88722.0,91210.0,"and you want to do anything
other than drive.",tiwVMrTLUWg
91210.0,92832.0,And the reason why is this:,tiwVMrTLUWg
92832.0,94690.0,Traffic is getting worse.,tiwVMrTLUWg
94690.0,98196.0,"In America, between 1990 and 2010,",tiwVMrTLUWg

102213.0,104962.0,"We grew by six percent of roads,",tiwVMrTLUWg
104962.0,106564.0,so it's not in your brains.,tiwVMrTLUWg
106564.0,110840.0,"Traffic really is substantially worse
than it was not very long ago.",tiwVMrTLUWg
110840.0,113249.0,And all of this has a very human cost.,tiwVMrTLUWg
113529.0,117477.0,"So if you take the average commute time
in America, which is about 50 minutes,",tiwVMrTLUWg
117477.0,121126.0,"you multiply that by the 120 million

about six billion minutes",tiwVMrTLUWg
123351.0,125377.0,wasted in commuting every day.,tiwVMrTLUWg
125377.0,128204.0,"Now, that's a big number,
so let's put it in perspective.",tiwVMrTLUWg
128204.0,129978.0,You take that six billion minutes,tiwVMrTLUWg
129978.0,133762.0,"and you divide it by the average
life expectancy of a person,",tiwVMrTLUWg
133762.0,136897.0,that turns out to be 162 lifetimes,tiwVMrTLUWg
136897.0,139822.0,"spent every day, wasted,",tiwVMrTLUWg
139822.0,141866.0,just getting from A to B.,tiwVMrTLUWg
141866.0,143596.0,It's unbelievable.,tiwVMrTLUWg
143596.0,146440.0,"And then, there are those of us

149690.0,151455.0,"He's an incredibly capable guy,",tiwVMrTLUWg
151455.0,153971.0,"but he just happens to be blind,",tiwVMrTLUWg

drive to work in the morning,",tiwVMrTLUWg
157188.0,161167.0,"it's a two-hour ordeal
of piecing together bits of public transit",tiwVMrTLUWg

167221.0,169681.0,We should do something about that.,tiwVMrTLUWg
169891.0,171648.0,"Now, conventional wisdom would say",tiwVMrTLUWg
171648.0,174140.0,"that we'll just take
these driver assistance systems",tiwVMrTLUWg
174140.0,177890.0,"and we'll kind of push them
and incrementally improve them,",tiwVMrTLUWg
177890.0,180432.0,"and over time, they'll turn
into self-driving cars.",tiwVMrTLUWg
180432.0,182841.0,"Well, I'm here to tell you
that's like me saying",tiwVMrTLUWg
182841.0,186898.0,"that if I work really hard at jumping,
one day I'll be able to fly.",tiwVMrTLUWg
186898.0,189626.0,"We actually need to do
something a little different.",tiwVMrTLUWg
189626.0,192337.0,"And so I'm going to talk to you
about three different ways",tiwVMrTLUWg
192337.0,195683.0,"that self-driving systems are different
than driver assistance systems.",tiwVMrTLUWg
195683.0,198334.0,"And I'm going to start
with some of our own experience.",tiwVMrTLUWg
198334.0,200587.0,"So back in 2013,",tiwVMrTLUWg
200587.0,203250.0,"we had the first test
of a self-driving car",tiwVMrTLUWg
203250.0,205277.0,where we let regular people use it.,tiwVMrTLUWg
205277.0,207479.0,"Well, almost regular --
they were 100 Googlers,",tiwVMrTLUWg
207479.0,209482.0,but they weren't working on the project.,tiwVMrTLUWg
209482.0,213103.0,"And we gave them the car and we allowed
them to use it in their daily lives.",tiwVMrTLUWg
213103.0,216822.0,"But unlike a real self-driving car,
this one had a big asterisk with it:",tiwVMrTLUWg
216822.0,218326.0,"They had to pay attention,",tiwVMrTLUWg
218326.0,220959.0,because this was an experimental vehicle.,tiwVMrTLUWg
220959.0,224484.0,"We tested it a lot,
but it could still fail.",tiwVMrTLUWg
224484.0,226543.0,"And so we gave them two hours of training,",tiwVMrTLUWg
226543.0,228635.0,"we put them in the car,
we let them use it,",tiwVMrTLUWg
228635.0,230762.0,"and what we heard back
was something awesome,",tiwVMrTLUWg
230762.0,233286.0,"as someone trying
to bring a product into the world.",tiwVMrTLUWg
233286.0,235211.0,Every one of them told us they loved it.,tiwVMrTLUWg
235211.0,238777.0,"In fact, we had a Porsche driver
who came in and told us on the first day,",tiwVMrTLUWg
238777.0,241440.0,This is completely stupid.,tiwVMrTLUWg
,,,tiwVMrTLUWg
241850.0,244690.0,"But at the end of it, he said,
Not only should I have it,""",tiwVMrTLUWg
244690.0,247865.0,"everyone else should have it,
because people are terrible drivers.""
85;249135;250870;So this was music to our ears,""",tiwVMrTLUWg
250870.0,254673.0,"but then we started to look at what
the people inside the car were doing,",tiwVMrTLUWg
254673.0,256252.0,and this was eye-opening.,tiwVMrTLUWg
256252.0,258690.0,"Now, my favorite story is this gentleman",tiwVMrTLUWg
258690.0,262519.0,"who looks down at his phone
and realizes the battery is low,",tiwVMrTLUWg
262519.0,267067.0,"so he turns around like this in the car
and digs around in his backpack,",tiwVMrTLUWg
267067.0,269220.0,"pulls out his laptop,",tiwVMrTLUWg
269220.0,270787.0,"puts it on the seat,",tiwVMrTLUWg
270787.0,272551.0,"goes in the back again,",tiwVMrTLUWg
272551.0,275918.0,"digs around, pulls out
the charging cable for his phone,",tiwVMrTLUWg
275918.0,279285.0,"futzes around, puts it into the laptop,
puts it on the phone.",tiwVMrTLUWg
279285.0,281328.0,"Sure enough, the phone is charging.",tiwVMrTLUWg
281328.0,285322.0,"All the time he's been doing
65 miles per hour down the freeway.",tiwVMrTLUWg
285322.0,287806.0,Right? Unbelievable.,tiwVMrTLUWg
287806.0,290927.0,"So we thought about this and we said,
it's kind of obvious, right?",tiwVMrTLUWg
290927.0,293190.0,"The better the technology gets,",tiwVMrTLUWg
293190.0,295311.0,"the less reliable
the driver is going to get.",tiwVMrTLUWg
295311.0,297707.0,"So by just making the cars
incrementally smarter,",tiwVMrTLUWg
297707.0,300609.0,"we're probably not going to see
the wins we really need.",tiwVMrTLUWg
300609.0,304510.0,"Let me talk about something
a little technical for a moment here.",tiwVMrTLUWg
304510.0,306948.0,"So we're looking at this graph,
and along the bottom",tiwVMrTLUWg
306948.0,309999.0,"is how often does the car
apply the brakes when it shouldn't.",tiwVMrTLUWg
309999.0,311620.0,"You can ignore most of that axis,",tiwVMrTLUWg
311620.0,315339.0,"because if you're driving around town,
and the car starts stopping randomly,",tiwVMrTLUWg
315339.0,317040.0,you're never going to buy that car.,tiwVMrTLUWg
317040.0,320415.0,"And the vertical axis is how often
the car is going to apply the brakes",tiwVMrTLUWg
320415.0,323464.0,"when it's supposed to
to help you avoid an accident.",tiwVMrTLUWg
323464.0,325685.0,"Now, if we look at
the bottom left corner here,",tiwVMrTLUWg
325685.0,327530.0,this is your classic car.,tiwVMrTLUWg
327530.0,330663.0,"It doesn't apply the brakes for you,
it doesn't do anything goofy,",tiwVMrTLUWg
330663.0,333442.0,"but it also doesn't get you
out of an accident.",tiwVMrTLUWg
333442.0,336460.0,"Now, if we want to bring
a driver assistance system into a car,",tiwVMrTLUWg
336460.0,338288.0,"say with collision mitigation braking,",tiwVMrTLUWg
338288.0,340900.0,"we're going to put some package
of technology on there,",tiwVMrTLUWg
340900.0,344318.0,"and that's this curve, and it's going
to have some operating properties,",tiwVMrTLUWg
344318.0,346808.0,"but it's never going to avoid
all of the accidents,",tiwVMrTLUWg
346808.0,348867.0,because it doesn't have that capability.,tiwVMrTLUWg
348867.0,351116.0,"But we'll pick some place
along the curve here,",tiwVMrTLUWg
351116.0,354370.0,"and maybe it avoids half of accidents
that the human driver misses,",tiwVMrTLUWg
354370.0,355667.0,"and that's amazing, right?",tiwVMrTLUWg
355667.0,358394.0,"We just reduced accidents on our roads
by a factor of two.",tiwVMrTLUWg
358394.0,362381.0,"There are now 17,000 less people
dying every year in America.",tiwVMrTLUWg
362381.0,364401.0,"But if we want a self-driving car,",tiwVMrTLUWg
364401.0,366708.0,"we need a technology curve
that looks like this.",tiwVMrTLUWg
366708.0,369307.0,"We're going to have to put
more sensors in the vehicle,",tiwVMrTLUWg
369307.0,371328.0,"and we'll pick some
operating point up here",tiwVMrTLUWg
371328.0,373347.0,"where it basically never
gets into a crash.",tiwVMrTLUWg
373347.0,375790.0,"They'll happen, but very low frequency.",tiwVMrTLUWg
375790.0,378251.0,"Now you and I could look at this
and we could argue",tiwVMrTLUWg
378251.0,381856.0,"about whether it's incremental, and
I could say something like 80-20 rule,""""",tiwVMrTLUWg
381856.0,384424.0,"and it's really hard to move up
to that new curve.",tiwVMrTLUWg
384424.0,387358.0,"But let's look at it
from a different direction for a moment.",tiwVMrTLUWg
387358.0,390870.0,"So let's look at how often
the technology has to do the right thing.",tiwVMrTLUWg
390870.0,394376.0,"And so this green dot up here
is a driver assistance system.",tiwVMrTLUWg
394376.0,396861.0,It turns out that human drivers,tiwVMrTLUWg
396861.0,399508.0,"make mistakes that lead
to traffic accidents",tiwVMrTLUWg
399508.0,402680.0,"about once every 100,000 miles in America.",tiwVMrTLUWg
402680.0,405847.0,"In contrast, a self-driving system
is probably making decisions",tiwVMrTLUWg
405847.0,409510.0,"about 10 times per second,",tiwVMrTLUWg
409510.0,410932.0,"so order of magnitude,",tiwVMrTLUWg
410932.0,413764.0,"that's about 1,000 times per mile.",tiwVMrTLUWg
413764.0,416249.0,"So if you compare the distance
between these two,",tiwVMrTLUWg
416249.0,418849.0,"it's about 10 to the eighth, right?",tiwVMrTLUWg
418849.0,420614.0,Eight orders of magnitude.,tiwVMrTLUWg
420614.0,423423.0,That's like comparing how fast I run,tiwVMrTLUWg
423423.0,425629.0,to the speed of light.,tiwVMrTLUWg
425629.0,429414.0,"It doesn't matter how hard I train,
I'm never actually going to get there.",tiwVMrTLUWg
429414.0,431852.0,So there's a pretty big gap there.,tiwVMrTLUWg
431852.0,435581.0,"And then finally, there's how
the system can handle uncertainty.",tiwVMrTLUWg
435581.0,438904.0,"So this pedestrian here might be
stepping into the road, might not be.",tiwVMrTLUWg
438904.0,442299.0,"I can't tell,
nor can any of our algorithms,",tiwVMrTLUWg
442310.0,444594.0,"but in the case of
a driver assistance system,",tiwVMrTLUWg
444594.0,447400.0,"that means it can't take action,
because again,",tiwVMrTLUWg
447400.0,450739.0,"if it presses the brakes unexpectedly,
that's completely unacceptable.",tiwVMrTLUWg
450739.0,453872.0,"Whereas a self-driving system
can look at that pedestrian and say,",tiwVMrTLUWg
453872.0,455762.0,"I don't know what they're about to do,",tiwVMrTLUWg
455762.0,459524.0,"slow down, take a better look,
and then react appropriately after that.",tiwVMrTLUWg
459524.0,463226.0,"So it can be much safer than
a driver assistance system can ever be.",tiwVMrTLUWg
463226.0,465956.0,"So that's enough about
the differences between the two.",tiwVMrTLUWg
465956.0,469440.0,"Let's spend some time talking about
how the car sees the world.",tiwVMrTLUWg
469440.0,470692.0,So this is our vehicle.,tiwVMrTLUWg
470692.0,473130.0,"It starts by understanding
where it is in the world,",tiwVMrTLUWg
473130.0,475917.0,"by taking a map and its sensor data
and aligning the two,",tiwVMrTLUWg
475917.0,478865.0,"and then we layer on top of that
what it sees in the moment.",tiwVMrTLUWg
478865.0,482520.0,"So here, all the purple boxes you can see
are other vehicles on the road,",tiwVMrTLUWg
482520.0,485048.0,"and the red thing on the side
over there is a cyclist,",tiwVMrTLUWg
485048.0,487450.0,"and up in the distance,
if you look really closely,",tiwVMrTLUWg
487450.0,489244.0,you can see some cones.,tiwVMrTLUWg
489244.0,492017.0,"Then we know where the car
is in the moment,",tiwVMrTLUWg
492017.0,495850.0,"but we have to do better than that:
we have to predict what's going to happen.",tiwVMrTLUWg
495850.0,499338.0,"So here the pickup truck in top right
is about to make a left lane change",tiwVMrTLUWg
499338.0,501561.0,"because the road in front of it is closed,",tiwVMrTLUWg
501561.0,503292.0,so it needs to get out of the way.,tiwVMrTLUWg
503292.0,505155.0,"Knowing that one pickup truck is great,",tiwVMrTLUWg
505155.0,507634.0,"but we really need to know
what everybody's thinking,",tiwVMrTLUWg
507634.0,510141.0,so it becomes quite a complicated problem.,tiwVMrTLUWg
510141.0,514890.0,"And then given that, we can figure out
how the car should respond in the moment,",tiwVMrTLUWg
514890.0,518756.0,"so what trajectory it should follow, how
quickly it should slow down or speed up.",tiwVMrTLUWg
518756.0,521821.0,"And then that all turns into
just following a path:",tiwVMrTLUWg
521821.0,525018.0,"turning the steering wheel left or right,
pressing the brake or gas.",tiwVMrTLUWg
525018.0,527482.0,"It's really just two numbers
at the end of the day.",tiwVMrTLUWg
527482.0,529723.0,So how hard can it really be?,tiwVMrTLUWg
530433.0,532385.0,"Back when we started in 2009,",tiwVMrTLUWg
532385.0,534183.0,this is what our system looked like.,tiwVMrTLUWg
534183.0,537574.0,"So you can see our car in the middle
and the other boxes on the road,",tiwVMrTLUWg
537574.0,538845.0,driving down the highway.,tiwVMrTLUWg
538845.0,542663.0,"The car needs to understand where it is

542663.0,545092.0,"It's really a geometric
understanding of the world.",tiwVMrTLUWg
545092.0,548040.0,"Once we started driving

of us, cars crossing in front of us,",tiwVMrTLUWg

555790.0,557317.0,"the traffic lights, crosswalks.",tiwVMrTLUWg
557317.0,560114.0,"It's an incredibly complicated
problem by comparison.",tiwVMrTLUWg
560114.0,562217.0,"And then once you have
that problem solved,",tiwVMrTLUWg
562217.0,564729.0,"the vehicle has to be able
to deal with construction.",tiwVMrTLUWg
564729.0,567880.0,"So here are the cones on the left
forcing it to drive to the right,",tiwVMrTLUWg
567880.0,570282.0,"but not just construction
in isolation, of course.",tiwVMrTLUWg
570282.0,574005.0,"It has to deal with other people moving
through that construction zone as well.",tiwVMrTLUWg
574005.0,577268.0,"And of course, if anyone's
breaking the rules, the police are there",tiwVMrTLUWg
577268.0,580890.0,"and the car has to understand that
that flashing light on the top of the car",tiwVMrTLUWg
580890.0,583995.0,"means that it's not just a car,
it's actually a police officer.",tiwVMrTLUWg
583995.0,586027.0,"Similarly, the orange box
on the side here,",tiwVMrTLUWg
586027.0,587136.0,"it's a school bus,",tiwVMrTLUWg
587136.0,589656.0,"and we have to treat that
differently as well.",tiwVMrTLUWg
590576.0,593369.0,"When we're out on the road,
other people have expectations:",tiwVMrTLUWg
593369.0,595149.0,"So, when a cyclist puts up their arm,",tiwVMrTLUWg
595149.0,598667.0,"it means they're expecting the car
to yield to them and make room for them",tiwVMrTLUWg
598667.0,600720.0,to make a lane change.,tiwVMrTLUWg
601030.0,603203.0,"And when a police officer
stood in the road,",tiwVMrTLUWg
603203.0,605943.0,"our vehicle should understand
that this means stop,",tiwVMrTLUWg
605943.0,609449.0,"and when they signal to go,
we should continue.",tiwVMrTLUWg
609449.0,613210.0,"Now, the way we accomplish this
is by sharing data between the vehicles.",tiwVMrTLUWg
613210.0,614906.0,"The first, most crude model of this",tiwVMrTLUWg
614906.0,617019.0,"is when one vehicle
sees a construction zone,",tiwVMrTLUWg
617019.0,620081.0,"having another know about it
so it can be in the correct lane",tiwVMrTLUWg
620081.0,621651.0,to avoid some of the difficulty.,tiwVMrTLUWg
621651.0,624315.0,"But we actually have a much
deeper understanding of this.",tiwVMrTLUWg
624315.0,627324.0,"We could take all of the data
that the cars have seen over time,",tiwVMrTLUWg
627324.0,629700.0,"the hundreds of thousands
of pedestrians, cyclists,",tiwVMrTLUWg
629700.0,631487.0,and vehicles that have been out there,tiwVMrTLUWg
631487.0,633182.0,and understand what they look like,tiwVMrTLUWg
633182.0,636013.0,"and use that to infer
what other vehicles should look like",tiwVMrTLUWg
636013.0,637939.0,and other pedestrians should look like.,tiwVMrTLUWg
637939.0,640960.0,"And then, even more importantly,
we could take from that a model",tiwVMrTLUWg
640960.0,643290.0,"of how we expect them
to move through the world.",tiwVMrTLUWg
643290.0,646253.0,"So here the yellow box is a pedestrian
crossing in front of us.",tiwVMrTLUWg
646253.0,648503.0,"Here the blue box is a cyclist
and we anticipate",tiwVMrTLUWg
648503.0,651815.0,"that they're going to nudge out
and around the car to the right.",tiwVMrTLUWg
652115.0,654207.0,"Here there's a cyclist
coming down the road",tiwVMrTLUWg
654207.0,657693.0,"and we know they're going to continue
to drive down the shape of the road.",tiwVMrTLUWg
657693.0,659560.0,"Here somebody makes a right turn,",tiwVMrTLUWg
659560.0,662920.0,"and in a moment here, somebody's
going to make a U-turn in front of us,",tiwVMrTLUWg
662920.0,665534.0,"and we can anticipate that behavior
and respond safely.",tiwVMrTLUWg
665534.0,668262.0,"Now, that's all well and good
for things that we've seen,",tiwVMrTLUWg
668262.0,671127.0,"but of course, you encounter
lots of things that you haven't",tiwVMrTLUWg
671127.0,672358.0,seen in the world before.,tiwVMrTLUWg
672358.0,674099.0,"And so just a couple of months ago,",tiwVMrTLUWg
674099.0,676334.0,"our vehicles were driving
through Mountain View,",tiwVMrTLUWg
676334.0,677978.0,and this is what we encountered.,tiwVMrTLUWg
677978.0,680060.0,This is a woman in an electric wheelchair,tiwVMrTLUWg
680060.0,682677.0,"chasing a duck in circles on the road.
(Laughter)",tiwVMrTLUWg
682677.0,685788.0,"Now it turns out, there is nowhere
in the DMV handbook",tiwVMrTLUWg
685788.0,688033.0,"that tells you how to deal with that,",tiwVMrTLUWg
688033.0,690176.0,"but our vehicles were able
to encounter that,",tiwVMrTLUWg
690176.0,692431.0,"slow down, and drive safely.",tiwVMrTLUWg
692431.0,694472.0,"Now, we don't have to deal
with just ducks.",tiwVMrTLUWg
694472.0,698180.0,"Watch this bird fly across in front of us.
The car reacts to that.",tiwVMrTLUWg
698180.0,699795.0,Here we're dealing with a cyclist,tiwVMrTLUWg
699795.0,703085.0,"that you would never expect to see
anywhere other than Mountain View.",tiwVMrTLUWg
703085.0,705153.0,"And of course, we have
to deal with drivers,",tiwVMrTLUWg
705153.0,708868.0,even the very small ones.,tiwVMrTLUWg
708868.0,712999.0,"Watch to the right as someone
jumps out of this truck at us.",tiwVMrTLUWg
714460.0,717389.0,"And now, watch the left as the car
with the green box decides",tiwVMrTLUWg
717389.0,720714.0,"he needs to make a right turn
at the last possible moment.",tiwVMrTLUWg
720714.0,723565.0,"Here, as we make a lane change,
the car to our left decides",tiwVMrTLUWg
723565.0,727118.0,it wants to as well.,tiwVMrTLUWg
727118.0,729811.0,"And here, we watch a car
blow through a red light",tiwVMrTLUWg
729811.0,731901.0,and yield to it.,tiwVMrTLUWg
731901.0,735755.0,"And similarly, here, a cyclist
blowing through that light as well.",tiwVMrTLUWg
735755.0,738501.0,"And of course,
the vehicle responds safely.",tiwVMrTLUWg
738501.0,741102.0,"And of course, we have people
who do I don't know what",tiwVMrTLUWg
741102.0,744925.0,"sometimes on the road, like this guy
pulling out between two self-driving cars.",tiwVMrTLUWg
744925.0,746970.0,"You have to ask, What are you thinking?""""",tiwVMrTLUWg
746970.0,748182.0,(Laughter),tiwVMrTLUWg
748182.0,750703.0,"Now, I just fire-hosed you
with a lot of stuff there,",tiwVMrTLUWg
750703.0,753353.0,"so I'm going to break one of these
down pretty quickly.",tiwVMrTLUWg
753353.0,756293.0,"So what we're looking at is the scene
with the cyclist again,",tiwVMrTLUWg
756293.0,759784.0,"and you might notice in the bottom,
we can't actually see the cyclist yet,",tiwVMrTLUWg
759784.0,762288.0,"but the car can: it's that little
blue box up there,",tiwVMrTLUWg
762288.0,764369.0,and that comes from the laser data.,tiwVMrTLUWg
764369.0,766787.0,"And that's not actually
really easy to understand,",tiwVMrTLUWg
766787.0,770371.0,"so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to turn that laser data and look at it,",tiwVMrTLUWg
770371.0,773400.0,"and if you're really good at looking
at laser data, you can see",tiwVMrTLUWg
773400.0,774887.0,"a few dots on the curve there,",tiwVMrTLUWg
774887.0,777259.0,"right there, and that blue box
is that cyclist.",tiwVMrTLUWg
777259.0,778408.0,"Now as our light is red,",tiwVMrTLUWg
778408.0,780600.0,"the cyclist's light
has turned yellow already,",tiwVMrTLUWg
780600.0,783038.0,"and if you squint, you can see that
in the imagery.",tiwVMrTLUWg
783038.0,786324.0,"But the cyclist, we see, is going
to proceed through the intersection.",tiwVMrTLUWg
786324.0,788718.0,"Our light has now turned green,
his is solidly red,",tiwVMrTLUWg
788718.0,793010.0,"and we now anticipate that this bike
is going to come all the way across.",tiwVMrTLUWg
793010.0,796752.0,"Unfortunately the other drivers next to us
were not paying as much attention.",tiwVMrTLUWg
796752.0,799909.0,"They started to pull forward,
and fortunately for everyone,",tiwVMrTLUWg
799909.0,802920.0,"this cyclists reacts, avoids,",tiwVMrTLUWg
802920.0,805111.0,and makes it through the intersection.,tiwVMrTLUWg
805111.0,806679.0,And off we go.,tiwVMrTLUWg
806679.0,809627.0,"Now, as you can see, we've made
some pretty exciting progress,",tiwVMrTLUWg
809627.0,811529.0,and at this point we're pretty convinced,tiwVMrTLUWg
811529.0,813539.0,"this technology is going
to come to market.",tiwVMrTLUWg
813539.0,818322.0,"We do three million miles of testing

this technology on the road,",tiwVMrTLUWg

that route and get to fully driverless",tiwVMrTLUWg

233330,235330,"I mean, the power of the city --",Y-SBzQnFx7A
235330,237330,"we talked about cities as being centralized in space,",Y-SBzQnFx7A

516330,518330,a weblog that has a lot of links to it,Y-SBzQnFx7A
518330,522330,is more authoritative than a weblog that has few links to it.,Y-SBzQnFx7A

538330,540330,I talked about the limitations of the one-way linking architecture,Y-SBzQnFx7A
540330,542330,"that, basically, you could link to somebody else",Y-SBzQnFx7A
542330,544330,but they wouldn't necessarily know that you were pointing to them.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
544330,547330,And that was one of the reasons why the web,Y-SBzQnFx7A
547330,549330,wasn't quite as emergent as it could be,Y-SBzQnFx7A
549330,551330,"because you needed two-way linking, you needed that kind of feedback mechanism",Y-SBzQnFx7A
551330,553330,to be able to really do interesting things.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
553330,556330,"Well, something like Technorati is supplying that.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
556330,559330,"Now what's interesting here is that this is a quote from Dave Weinberger,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
559330,563330,where he talks about everything being purposive in the Web --,Y-SBzQnFx7A
563330,565330,there's nothing artificial.,Y-SBzQnFx7A

575330,578330,"And in fact, I think that's not entirely true anymore.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
578330,582330,I could put up a feed of all those links generated by Technorati,Y-SBzQnFx7A
582330,584330,"on the right-hand side of my page,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
584330,587330,and they would change as the overall ecology of the Web changes.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
587330,589330,That little list there would change.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
589330,591330,I wouldn't really be directly in control of it.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
591330,594330,"So it's much closer, in a way, to a data fungus, in a sense,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
594330,598330,"wrapped around that page, than it is to a deliberate link that I've placed there.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
600330,603330,"Now, what you're having here is basically a global brain",Y-SBzQnFx7A
603330,606330,that you're able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it's thinking.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
606330,608330,And there are all these interesting tools.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
608330,610330,"Google does the Google Zeitgeist,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
610330,615330,"which looks at search requests to test what's going on, what people are interested in,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
615330,617330,and they publish it with lots of fun graphs.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
617330,619330,"And I'm saying a lot of nice things about Google,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
619330,620330,so I'll be I'll be saying one little critical thing.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
620330,622330,"There's a problem with the Google Zeitgeist,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
622330,626330,which is it often comes back with news that a lot of people are searching,Y-SBzQnFx7A
626330,630330,"for Britney Spears pictures, which is not necessarily news.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
630330,634330,"The Columbia blows up, suddenly there are a lot of searches on Columbia.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
634330,636330,"Well, you know, we should expect to see that.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
636330,638330,That's not necessarily something we didn't know already.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
638330,640330,So the key thing in terms of these new tools,Y-SBzQnFx7A
640330,643330,"that are kind of plumbing the depths of the global brain,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
643330,647330,that are sending kind of trace dyes through that whole bloodstream --,Y-SBzQnFx7A
647330,649330,"the question is, are you finding out something new?",Y-SBzQnFx7A
649330,652330,And one of the things that I experimented with is this thing called Google Share,Y-SBzQnFx7A
652330,656330,"which is basically, you take an abstract term,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
656330,659330,"and you search Google for that term,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
659330,662330,and then you search the results that you get back for somebody's name.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
662330,666330,"So basically, the number of pages that mention this term,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
666330,669330,"that also mention this page, the percentage of those pages",Y-SBzQnFx7A
669330,671330,is that person's Google Share of that term.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
671330,673330,So you can do kind of interesting contests.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
673330,677330,"Like for instance, this is a Google Share of the TED Conference.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
677330,680330,So Richard Saul Wurman,Y-SBzQnFx7A
680330,684330,has about a 15 percent Google Share of the TED conference.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
684330,689330,"Our good friend Chris has about a six percent -- but with a bullet, I might add.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
689330,691330,(Laughter),Y-SBzQnFx7A
691330,694330,"But the interesting thing is, you can broaden the search a little bit.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
694330,697330,"And it turns out, actually, that 42 percent is the Mola mola fish.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
697330,699330,I had no idea.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
699330,700330,"No, that's not true.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
700330,703330,(Laughter),Y-SBzQnFx7A
703330,705330,I made that up because I just wanted to put up a slide,Y-SBzQnFx7A
705330,707330,of the Mola mola fish.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
707330,709330,(Laughter),Y-SBzQnFx7A
709330,712330,I also did -- and I don't want to start a little fight in the next panel --,Y-SBzQnFx7A
712330,715330,but I did a Google Share analysis of evolution and natural selection.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
715330,720330,"So right here -- now this is a big category, you have smaller percentages,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
720330,725330,"so this is 0.7 percent -- Dan Dennett, who'll be speaking shortly.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
725330,729330,"Right below him, 0.5 percent, Steven Pinker.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
730330,732330,So Dennett's in the lead a little bit there.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
732330,734330,But what's interesting is you can then broaden the search,Y-SBzQnFx7A
734330,738330,and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
738330,741330,So Gary Bauer is not too far behind --,Y-SBzQnFx7A
741330,746330,has slightly different theories about evolution and natural selection.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
746330,749330,And right behind him is L. Ron Hubbard. So --,Y-SBzQnFx7A
749330,751330,(Laughter),Y-SBzQnFx7A
751330,753330,"you can see we're in the ascot, which is always good.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
753330,755330,"And by the way, Chris, that would've been a really good panel,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
755330,756330,"I think, right there.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
756330,761330,(Laughter),Y-SBzQnFx7A
761330,763330,"Hubbard apparently started to reach, but besides that,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
763330,765330,I think it would be good next year.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
765330,767330,"Another quick thing -- this is a slightly different thing,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
767330,769330,but this analysis some of you may have seen.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
769330,771330,"It just came out. This is bursty words,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
771330,775330,looking at the historical record of State of the Union Addresses.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
776330,780330,"So these are words that suddenly start to appear out of nowhere,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
780330,782330,"so they're kind of, you know, memes that start taking off,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
782330,784330,that didn't have a lot of historical precedent before.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
785330,788330,So the first one is -- these are the bursty words around 1860s --,Y-SBzQnFx7A
788330,790330,"slaves, emancipation, slavery, rebellion, Kansas.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
791330,793330,"That's Britney Spears. I mean, you know, OK, interesting.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
793330,795330,They're talking about slavery in 1860.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
795330,798330,"1935 -- relief, depression, recovery banks.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
798330,801330,"And OK, I didn't learn anything new there as well -- that's pretty obvious.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
801330,804330,"1985, right at the center of the Reagan years --",Y-SBzQnFx7A
805330,808330,"that's, we're, there's, we've, it's.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
808330,810330,(Laughter),Y-SBzQnFx7A
810330,813330,"Now, there's one way to interpret this, which is to say that",Y-SBzQnFx7A
813330,816330,"emancipation"" and ""depression"" and ""recovery"" all have a lot of syllables.""",Y-SBzQnFx7A
816330,819330,"So you know, you can actually download -- it's hard to remember those.",Y-SBzQnFx7A
821330,823330,"But seriously, actually, what you can see there,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
823330,825330,"in a way that would be very hard to detect otherwise,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
825330,828330,is Reagan reinventing the political language of the country,Y-SBzQnFx7A

846330,848330,I'll go very quickly.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
848330,850330,The question now -- and this is the really interesting question --,Y-SBzQnFx7A
850330,854330,"is, what kind of higher-level shape is emerging right now",Y-SBzQnFx7A
854330,858330,in the overall Web ecosystem -- and particularly in the ecosystem of the blogs,Y-SBzQnFx7A
858330,861330,because they are really kind of at the cutting edge.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
861330,863330,And I think what happens there will also happen in the wider system.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
863330,866330,Now there was a very interesting article by Clay Shirky,Y-SBzQnFx7A
866330,868330,"that got a lot of attention about a month ago,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
868330,870330,and this is basically the distribution of links,Y-SBzQnFx7A
870330,873330,on the web to all these various different blogs.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
875330,880330,"It follows a power law, so that there are a few extremely well-linked to, popular blogs,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
880330,884330,and a long tail of blogs with very few links.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
884330,887330,So 20 percent of the blogs get 80 percent of the links.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
887330,889330,Now this is a very interesting thing.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
889330,891330,It's caused a lot of controversy,Y-SBzQnFx7A
891330,893330,"because people thought that this was the ultimate kind of one man,",Y-SBzQnFx7A
893330,897330,"one modem democracy, where anybody can get out there and get their voice heard.",Y-SBzQnFx7A

914330,917330,the underlying rules of the system so that a different shape would start appearing.,Y-SBzQnFx7A
917330,919330,"And basically, the shape appears",Y-SBzQnFx7A

12160,14160,I'm going to go right into the slides.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
14160,16160,And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
16160,19160,is that I do just very straight stuff.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
21160,24160,And my ideas are --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
25160,27160,"in my head, anyway -- they're very logical",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
27160,33160,and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
33160,40160,"I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
40160,42160,"or I really do solve their problems,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
42160,45160,because usually they seem to like it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
45160,49160,Let me go right into the slides.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
49160,54160,Can you turn off the light? Down.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
54160,56160,I like to be in the dark.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
56160,58160,I don't want you to see what I'm doing up here.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
58160,60160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
60160,63160,"Anyway, I did this house in Santa Monica,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
63160,66160,and it got a lot of notoriety.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
66160,69160,"In fact, it appeared in a porno comic book,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
69160,72160,which is the slide on the right.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
72160,76160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
80160,83160,This is in Venice.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
83160,86160,I just show it because I want you to know,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
86160,88160,I'm concerned about context.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
88160,90160,"On the left-hand side,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
90160,93160,"I had the context of those little houses,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
93160,96160,and I tried to build a building that fit into that context.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
96160,100160,When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
100160,102160,"they look really weird,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
102160,105160,and my premise is that they make a lot more sense,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
105160,110160,when they're photographed or seen in that space.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
110160,114160,"And then, once I deal with the context,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
114160,121160,"I then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
121160,126160,as I hope you'll find that slide on the right.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
126160,132160,And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
132160,136160,I was concerned about making a place for the study of law.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
138160,142160,And we continue to work with this client.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
142160,147160,The building on the right at the top is now under construction.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
147160,153160,"The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
153160,157160,"finally, and several small classrooms will be placed",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
157160,161160,"along this avenue that we've created, this campus.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
161160,167160,And it all related to the clients and the students,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
167160,172160,from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
172160,174160,They wanted a sense of place.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
174160,178160,And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
178160,185160,"in downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
185160,189160,"And it was my theory, or my point of view,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
189160,194160,that one didn't upstage the neighborhood --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
194160,196160,one made accommodations.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
196160,200160,"I tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
200160,204160,whether they were buildings I liked or not.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
205160,208160,In the '60s I started working with paper furniture,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
208160,213160,and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
213160,218160,"We even made flooring, walls and everything, out of cardboard.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
218160,222160,And the success of it threw me for a loop.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
222160,224160,I couldn't deal with the success of furniture --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
224160,226160,I wasn't secure enough as an architect --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
226160,231160,and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
231160,236160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
239160,241160,"So, nobody would like this.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
241160,245160,"And it was in this, preliminary to these pieces of furniture,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
245160,249160,that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
249160,253160,"And after we failed, I just kept failing.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
253160,261160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
261160,263160,The piece on the left --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
263160,266160,and that ultimately led to the piece on the right --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
266160,269160,happened when the kid that was working on this,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
269160,272160,took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
272160,274160,to put it in the wastebasket.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
274160,277160,"And I put a piece of tape around it,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
277160,280160,"as you see there, and realized you could sit on it,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
280160,283160,and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
283160,286160,"So, it was an accidental discovery.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
293160,296160,I got into fish.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
296160,303160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
303160,309160,"I mean, the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
309160,315160,"and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
315160,318160,"and if you're going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
318160,324160,And so I started making these funny things.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
324160,329160,And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
330160,332160,as the one glass at the Walker.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
332160,336160,"And then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
336160,339160,and tried to translate what I was learning,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
339160,343160,about the form of the fish and the movement.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
343160,346160,And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
346160,348160,"accidental, again --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
348160,353160,"it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
353160,359160,"and made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
359160,363160,I did this building in Japan.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
364160,367160,I was taken out to dinner after the contract,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
367160,370160,for this little restaurant was signed.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
370160,374160,And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
374160,379160,And after I got -- I was really drunk --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
380160,384160,I was asked to do some sketches on napkins.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
384160,388160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
388160,392160,And I made some sketches on napkins --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
392160,395160,little boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
395160,399160,"And the client said, Why no fish?""""",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
399160,403160,"And so I made a drawing with a fish, and I left Japan.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
403160,406160,"Three weeks later, I received a complete set of drawings",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
406160,409160,saying we'd won the competition.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
409160,418160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
418160,423160,"Now, it's hard to do. It's hard to translate a fish form,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
423160,425160,because they're so beautiful -- perfect --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
425160,429160,into a building or object like this.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
430160,434160,"And Oldenburg, who I work with a little once in a while,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
434160,440160,"told me I couldn't do it, and so that made it even more exciting.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
442160,445160,But he was right -- I couldn't do the tail.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
445160,449160,"I started to get the head OK, but the tail I couldn't do.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
449160,451160,It was pretty hard.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
451160,454160,"The thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
454160,457160,"And I put them together, and you walk between them.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
457160,460160,It was a dialog with the context again.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
460160,463160,"Now, if you saw a picture of this",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
463160,466160,as it was published in Architectural Record --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
466160,469160,"they didn't show the context, so you would think,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
469160,472160,"God, what a pushy guy this is.""""",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
472160,474160,But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
474160,476160,looking for this restaurant.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
476160,478160,Couldn't find it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
478160,479160,So ...,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
479160,485160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
488160,492160,As for craft and technology and all those things,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
492160,497160,"that you've all been talking about, I was thrown for a complete loop.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
497160,499160,This was built in six months.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
499160,503160,The way we sent drawings to Japan:,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
503160,508160,"we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
508160,512160,"and we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
512160,515160,We made the drawings of the fish and the scales.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
515160,518160,"And when I got there, everything was perfect --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
518160,522160,except the tail.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
522160,526160,"So, I decided to cut off the head and the tail.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
527160,531160,And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
531160,534160,"And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made, I think.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
534160,537160,"And then Jay Chiat, a friend and client,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
537160,541160,asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
541160,547160,"For reasons we don't want to talk about, it got delayed.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
547160,552160,"Toxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
552160,558160,And so we built a temporary building -- I'm getting good at temporary --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
558160,561160,and we put a conference room in that's a fish.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
563160,568160,"And, finally, Jay dragged me to my hometown, Toronto, Canada.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
568160,572160,And there is a story -- it's a real story -- about my grandmother,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
572160,574160,"buying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
574160,576160,putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
576160,578160,I played with it in the evening.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
578160,581160,"When I went to sleep, the next day it wasn't there.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
581160,583160,"And the next night, we had gefilte fish.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
583160,585160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
585160,591160,And so I set up this interior for Jay's offices,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
591160,593160,and I made a pedestal for a sculpture.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
593160,597160,"And he didn't buy a sculpture, so I made one.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
597160,600160,"I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
600160,602160,and I put the fish in.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
602160,605160,It was a joke.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
605160,611160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
611160,615160,I play with funny people like [Claes] Oldenburg.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
615160,618160,We've been friends for a long time.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
618160,623160,And we've started to work on things.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
623160,627160,"A few years ago, we did a performance piece in Venice, Italy,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
627160,634160,"called Il Corso del Coltello"" -- the Swiss Army knife.""",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
634160,637160,And most of the imagery is --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
637160,640160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
640160,643160,"Claes', but those two little boys are my sons,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
643160,647160,and they were Claes' assistants in the play.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
647160,650160,He was the Swiss Army knife.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
650160,654160,"He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
654160,656160,and I was Frankie P. Toronto.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
656160,658160,P for Palladio.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
658160,662160,Dressed up like the AT&amp;T building by Claes --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
662160,665160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
665160,669160,with a fish hat.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
669160,673160,The highlight of the performance was at the end.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
673160,676160,"This beautiful object, the Swiss Army knife,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
676160,679160,which I get credit for participating in.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
679160,682160,And I can tell you -- it's totally an Oldenburg.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
682160,683160,I had nothing to do with it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
683160,686160,"The only thing I did was, I made it possible for them",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
686160,689160,"to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
689160,691160,because I love sailing.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
691160,693160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
693160,695160,We made it into a sailing craft.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
696160,699160,I've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
699160,703160,"I do it because it's a curious thing in the culture,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
703160,706160,"when things are made in such great quantities,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
706160,708160,"absorbed in such great quantities,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
708160,710160,and there's so much denial about them.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
710160,712160,People hate it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
712160,716160,"And I'm fascinated with that, which, like the paper furniture --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
716160,718160,it's one of those materials.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
718160,720160,And I'm always drawn to that.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
720160,723160,"And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
723160,725160,which nobody will forgive me for.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
725160,729160,But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
729160,731160,And that chain link is really expensive.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
731160,733160,It's in perspective and everything.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
736160,740160,And then we did a camp together for children with cancer.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
740160,744160,"And you can see, we started making a building together.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
744160,747160,"Of course, the milk can is his.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
747160,749160,"But we were trying to collide our ideas,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
749160,751160,to put objects next to each other.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
751160,756160,Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
756160,765160,And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
765160,769160,Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
769160,775160,"on this funny lot in Venice, and I started with this three-piece thing,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
775160,777160,and you entered in the middle.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
777160,780160,And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
780160,782160,And he pushed that.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
782160,785160,"And one day I had a -- oh, well, the other way.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
785160,788160,"I had the binoculars from Claes, and I put them there,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
788160,791160,and I could never get rid of them after that.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
794160,797160,Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
797160,802160,when he sent me the first model of the real proposal.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
802160,804160,It made my building look sick.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
804160,806160,And it was this interaction between,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
806160,811160,"that kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
811160,813160,It led to the building on the left.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
813160,817160,"And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars, you know,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
817160,823160,leaving out the -- what the hell.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
827160,829160,"I use a lot of metal in my work,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
829160,833160,and I have a hard time connecting with the craft.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
833160,836160,"The whole thing about my house,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
836160,839160,"the whole use of rough carpentry and everything,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
839160,842160,was the frustration with the crafts available.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
842160,846160,"I said, If I can't get the craft that I want,""",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
846160,848160,"I'll use the craft I can get.""
224;848160;850160;There were plenty of models for that,""",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
850160,853160,"in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
853160,860160,who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
860160,863160,I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
863160,867160,that was a sculpture.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
867160,869160,"And it was all of one material,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
869160,872160,and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
872160,875160,"The metalworkers, for the most part,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
875160,878160,do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
878160,881160,I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
881160,888160,"for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
888160,890160,and I did it on the condition that they become my partners,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
890160,896160,"in the future and help me with all future metal buildings, etc. etc.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
896160,898160,And it's working very well,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
898160,901160,"to have these people, these craftsmen, interested in it.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
901160,903160,I just tell the stories.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
903160,908160,"It's a way of connecting, at least, with some of those people",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
908160,912160,that are so important to the realization of architecture.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
917160,922160,"The metal continued into a building -- Herman Miller, in Sacramento.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
923160,927160,And it's just a complex of factory buildings.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
927160,932160,And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
932160,934160,a people place.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
934160,937160,"I mean, it's kind of a trite thing to say,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
937160,941160,but it is real that they wanted to have a central place,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
941160,945160,"where the cafeteria would be, where the people would come",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
945160,949160,and where the people working would interact.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
950160,955160,"So it's out in the middle of nowhere, and you approach it.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
955160,958160,It's copper and galvanize.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
958160,961160,I used the galvanize and copper,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
961160,965160,"in a very light gauge, so it would buckle.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
965160,970160,I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
972160,974160,"Everybody's trying to get the panels perfect,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
974160,978160,and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
978160,981160,And they end up looking like stone.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
981160,983160,This is the central area.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
983160,985160,There's a ramp.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
985160,988160,And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
988160,991160,Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
991160,995160,"And when I was awarded the contract I, at the very beginning,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
995160,1000160,asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1000160,1004160,"Because these were ideas that we were talking about,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1004160,1007160,"building things next to each other, making --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1007160,1009160,"it's all about [a] metaphor for a city, maybe.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1009160,1012160,And so Stanley did the little dome thing.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1012160,1014160,And we did it over the phone and by fax.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1014160,1017160,He would send me a fax and show me something.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1017160,1020160,He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1020160,1023160,"I told him, No, no, that's too ongepotchket.""",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1023160,1025160,"I don't want the tower.""
273;1027160;1031160;So he came back with a simpler building,""",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1031160,1037160,"but he put some funny details on it,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1037160,1041160,and he moved it closer to my building.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1041160,1045160,And so I decided to put him in a depression.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1045160,1049160,I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1049160,1053160,"And so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1053160,1055160,going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1055160,1059160,And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1059160,1062160,And so then I put this big billboard behind it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1062160,1065160,"And I call it, David and Goliath.""""",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1068160,1071160,And that's my cafeteria.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1075160,1080160,"In Boston, we had that old building on the left.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1080160,1083160,"It was a very prominent building off the freeway,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1083160,1087160,and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1087160,1092160,"and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1092160,1096160,"which had these cornices, projecting cornices.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1096160,1103160,"Mine got a little exuberant, but I used lead copper,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1103160,1108160,"which is a beautiful material, and it turns green in 100 years.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1108160,1112160,"Instead of, like, copper in 10 or 15.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1114160,1116160,We redid the side of the building,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1116160,1120160,and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1120160,1124160,"And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1124160,1129160,"because they have very strict kind of design guideline,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1130160,1135160,and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1135160,1138160,The detailing was very careful with the lead copper,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1138160,1144160,and making panels and fitting it tightly,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1144160,1147160,into the fabric of the existing building.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1150160,1156160,"In Barcelona, on Las Ramblas for some film festival,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1156160,1159160,"I did the Hollywood sign going and coming,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1159160,1162160,"made a building out of it, and they built it.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1162160,1165160,I flew in one night and took this picture.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1165160,1170160,But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1172160,1178160,And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1178160,1180160,a little shopping center.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1185160,1189160,"And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1190160,1194160,in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1194160,1207160,"It's the support labs, which, by some coincidence, required no windows.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1207160,1212160,And the shape fit perfectly.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1212160,1214160,I just joined the points.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1214160,1218160,In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1218160,1223160,That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1223160,1226160,"and so it was an opportunity that I seized,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1226160,1232160,because I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1232160,1234160,It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1237160,1244160,This is a small house somewhere.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1244160,1247160,They've been building it so long I don't remember where it is.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1247160,1249160,It's in the West Valley.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1249160,1252160,And we started with the stream,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1253160,1257160,and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1258160,1260160,These are the models.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1263160,1265160,"The reality, with the lake --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1266160,1270160,the workmanship is pretty bad.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1270160,1276160,And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1276160,1280160,"When you have to do something really cheaply,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1280160,1285160,it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1296160,1302160,"That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1302160,1305160,"you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1305160,1307160,which is on the right.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1313160,1315160,It's kind of like a whole built town.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1320160,1327160,I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1327160,1331160,I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1336160,1340160,This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1342160,1346160,The owners had a dilemma -- they asked Philip to do it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1346160,1348160,He was too busy.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1349160,1352160,"He didn't recommend me, by the way.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1352160,1354160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1354160,1360160,"We ended up having to make it a sculpture, because the dilemma was,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1360160,1363160,how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language?,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1363160,1367160,Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided?,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1367160,1369160,Etc. etc.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1369160,1371160,You've got the idea.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1371160,1373160,And so we finally ended up making it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1373160,1375160,These people are art collectors.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1375160,1379160,And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1379160,1384160,from the main house and all the windows are on the other side.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1387160,1392160,And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1392160,1398160,It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1398160,1402160,it's that formed lumber from Finland.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1402160,1405160,"We used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1405160,1407160,I keep trying to make it work.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1407160,1410160,In this case we learned how to detail it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1413160,1420160,"In Cleveland, there's Burnham Mall, on the left.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1420160,1422160,It's never been finished.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1422160,1427160,"Going out to the lake, you can see all those new buildings we built.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1427160,1433160,And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1433160,1435160,There's a railroad track.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1435160,1440160,"This is the city hall over here somewhere, and the courthouse.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1440160,1444160,And the centerline of the mall goes out.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1444160,1449160,"Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1449160,1451160,and so we followed.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1451160,1453160,"Sohio is on the axis here,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1453160,1456160,"and we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1456160,1458160,"And this is our building,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1458160,1462160,which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1462160,1467160,"We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top, folded.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1473160,1477160,The health club is fastened to the garage,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1477160,1480160,"with a C-clamp, for Cleveland.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1480160,1482160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1482160,1484160,You drive down.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1484160,1487160,So it's about a 10-story C-clamp.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1487160,1490160,"And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1490160,1494160,and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1494160,1497160,This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1498160,1500160,And this would be a hotel.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1500160,1502160,"So, the centerline of this thing -- we'd preserve it,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1502160,1506160,and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1506160,1511160,"by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1522160,1524160,It's hard to do high-rise.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1524160,1527160,I feel much more comfortable down here.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1528160,1531160,This is a piece of property in Brentwood.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1531160,1537160,"And a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1537160,1540160,I designed a house for myself,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1540160,1545160,that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1545160,1550160,and the owner of this lot worked for me,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1550160,1552160,and built that actual model on the left.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1552160,1554160,"And she came back,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1554160,1558160,I guess wealthier or something -- something happened --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1558160,1564160,and asked me to design a house for her on this site.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1566160,1571160,"And following that basic idea of the village,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1571160,1573160,we changed it as we got into it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1573160,1578160,I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1578160,1581160,here you see on the photographs of the site --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1581160,1585160,slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1585160,1590160,"like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1590160,1593160,"which I designed like a kind of a barge,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1593160,1595160,looking like a boat.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1597160,1602160,"And that's it, built.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1604160,1608160,The dome was a request from the client.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1608160,1610160,She wanted a dome somewhere in the house.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1610160,1612160,She didn't care where.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1612160,1614160,"When you sleep in this bedroom, I hope --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1614160,1616160,"I mean, I haven't slept in it yet.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1617160,1621160,"I've offered to marry her so I could sleep there,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1621160,1629160,but she said I didn't have to do that.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1629160,1632160,"But when you're in that room,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1632160,1636160,you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1636160,1638160,And it's very private.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1638160,1641160,The landscape is being built around to create a private garden.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1641160,1646160,"And then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1646160,1648160,and one on the other side.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1651160,1653160,These aren't focused very well.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1653160,1657160,I don't know how to do it from here.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1657160,1660160,Focus the one on the right.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1661160,1663160,It's up there.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1663160,1666160,Left -- it's my right.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1667160,1673160,"Anyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1673160,1675160,That's the living room.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1675160,1677160,Servants' quarters.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1677160,1681160,"A guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1681160,1686160,And then you enter into the living room and then so on.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1691160,1693160,This is the bedroom.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1693160,1695160,"You come down from this level along the stairway,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1695160,1698160,"and you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1698160,1700160,"And the bed is back in this space,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1700160,1703160,with windows looking out onto the lake.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1703160,1708160,These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1708160,1712160,and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1712160,1717160,"The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1721160,1726160,And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1726160,1732160,it's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1732160,1738160,and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1738160,1740160,with a high space in it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1745160,1748160,And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1748160,1750160,with the dining room table.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1752160,1756160,It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1757160,1759160,"But the idea is, the windows are all placed",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1759160,1763160,so you see pieces of the house outside.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1763160,1767160,Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1767160,1769160,and it will be very private.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1769160,1772160,And you feel like you're in your own kind of village.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1777160,1782160,This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1782160,1785160,We're doing some work for him.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1785160,1790160,"And this is in Anaheim, California, and it's a freeway building.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1790160,1794160,"You go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1794160,1796160,and there's another bridge here.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1796160,1798160,"And you're through this room in a split second,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1798160,1800160,and the building will sort of reflect that.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1800160,1803160,"On the backside, it's much more humane -- entrance,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1803160,1805160,"dining hall, etc.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1805160,1810160,And then this thing here -- I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1810160,1813160,the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1814160,1818160,Kind of a fun thing to do.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1820160,1824160,"I'm doing a building in Switzerland, Basel,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1824160,1827160,which is an office building for a furniture company.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1827160,1830160,And we struggled with the image.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1830160,1833160,"These are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1833160,1838160,"to normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1838160,1842160,"then people might say, Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing,""",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1842160,1844160,"but no, it ain't going to look good in my normal building.""
462;1844160;1848160;So we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here,""",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1848160,1852160,and we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1852160,1856160,so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1856160,1860160,And you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1860160,1863160,interaction between these pieces.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1864160,1868160,"This is in Paris, along the Seine.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1868160,1872160,"Palais des Sports, the Gare de Lyon over here.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1872160,1876160,The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1876160,1879160,There's a new library across the river.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1879160,1883160,"And back in here, in this already treed park,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1883160,1887160,"we're doing a very dense building called the American Center,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1887160,1894160,"which has a theater, apartments, dance school, an art museum,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1894160,1898160,restaurants and all kinds of -- it's a very dense program --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1898160,1901160,"bookstores, etc.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1901160,1903160,"In a very tight, small --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1903160,1906160,this is the ground level.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1906160,1909160,And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1909160,1913160,by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1913160,1915160,They call it the plan coupe.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1915160,1921160,And I struggled with that thing --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1921160,1923160,how to get around the corner.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1923160,1926160,These are the models for it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1926160,1929160,"I showed you the other model, the one --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1934160,1937160,this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1937160,1943160,so I understood the problem.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1943160,1947160,I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it?,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1947160,1950160,"Apartments, etc.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1950160,1952160,And these are the kind of study models we did.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1952160,1956160,And the one on the left is pretty awful.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1956160,1961160,You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1961160,1968160,"But out of it came finally this resolution, where the elevator piece",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1968160,1971160,"worked frontally to this, parallel to this street,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1971160,1973160,and also parallel to here.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1973160,1977160,"And then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1977160,1983160,kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1983160,1986160,"The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater, etc.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1986160,1990160,"So it would all be built in stone, in French limestone,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1990160,1992160,except for this metal piece.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1992160,1995160,And it faces into a park.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
1995160,2000160,And the idea was to make this express the energy of this.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2003160,2007160,"On the side facing the street it's much more normal,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2007160,2013160,"except I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2013160,2017160,these housing units made a gesture to the corner.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2026160,2031160,And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2031160,2033160,"If any of you guys have any ideas for it, please contact me.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8

2058160,2059160,There it is.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2059160,2060160,But it's the living room.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2060160,2062160,And this piece here is --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2062160,2064160,I don't know what it is.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2064160,2066160,I just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8

2097160,2099160,So far.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2099160,2102160,This is a shopping thing.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2102160,2105160,You come into the Magic Kingdom,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2105160,2109160,and the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2109160,2112160,"And then this is a kind of a shopping mall,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2112160,2115160,with a rodeo and restaurants.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2115160,2118160,And another restaurant.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2118160,2123160,"What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2123160,2126160,"I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2126160,2128160,to the route of the train.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2128160,2131160,"It looks like it's kind of been there,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2131160,2135160,and then crashed all these simpler forms into it.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2135160,2141160,"The light grid will have a light, be lit up at night and give a",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2141160,2144160,kind of light ceiling.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2152160,2156160,"In Switzerland -- Germany, actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2156160,2160160,we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2160160,2163160,"And I tried to -- there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2163160,2166160,there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2166160,2170160,I tried to make a relationship urbanistically.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2170160,2173160,And I don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2173160,2177160,"but this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2177160,2182160,And as you pass by it's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2182160,2187160,accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2192160,2195160,It's plaster and just zinc.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2195160,2198160,"And you wonder, if this is a museum,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2198160,2200160,what it's going to be like inside?,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2200160,2204160,"If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2204160,2206160,and just wait.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2206160,2211160,I'm so cunning and clever -- I made it quiet and wonderful.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2211160,2216160,But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2219160,2224160,It's actually basically three square rooms,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2224160,2226160,with a couple of skylights and stuff.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2226160,2229160,"And from the building in the back, you see it as",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2229160,2232160,an iceberg floating by in the hills.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2235160,2238160,I know I'm over time.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2253160,2256160,"See, that skylight goes down and becomes that one.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2256160,2260160,So it's pretty quiet inside.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2263160,2267160,This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2267160,2271160,It's a complicated project.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2271160,2273160,It has a chamber hall.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2273160,2277160,It's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2277160,2280160,with a lot of love and tears and caring.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2280160,2285160,"And it's not a great building, but I approached it optimistically,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2285160,2292160,that we would make a compositional relationship between us,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2293160,2296160,that would strengthen both of us.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2296160,2298160,And the plan of this -- it's a concert hall.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2298160,2301160,"This is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2301160,2303160,There's commercial at the ground floor.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2303160,2307160,"These are offices, which, really, in the competition,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2307160,2309160,we didn't have to design.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2309160,2313160,"But finally, there's a hotel there.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2313160,2318160,"These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2318160,2322160,composing these elevations together and relating them,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2322160,2327160,"to the buildings that existed -- to MOCA, etc.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2331160,2336160,"The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2336160,2340160,"which led to this compartmentalized scheme,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2340160,2344160,which we found out after the competition would not work at all.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2344160,2349160,"But everybody liked these forms and liked the space,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2349160,2351160,and so that's one of the problems of a competition.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2351160,2357160,You have to then try and get that back in some way.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2357160,2361160,And we studied many models.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2361160,2363160,This was our original model.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2363160,2367160,These were the three buildings that were the ideal --,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2367160,2370160,"the Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2370160,2373160,Everybody liked the surround.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2373160,2376160,"Actually, this is the smallest hall in size,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2376160,2379160,and it has more seats than any of these,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2379160,2381160,because it has double balconies.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2381160,2384160,"Our client doesn't want balconies, so --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2384160,2386160,"and when we met our new acoustician, he told us",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2386160,2389160,this was the right shape or this was the right shape.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2389160,2393160,"And we tried many shapes, trying to get the energy",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2393160,2401160,"of the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2401160,2403160,We finally settled on a shape that was,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2403160,2406160,the proportion of the Concertgebouw,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2406160,2411160,"with the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician said",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2411160,2414160,"were crucial to this and later decided they weren't,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2414160,2416160,but now we have them.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2416160,2418160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2418160,2423160,And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2423160,2429160,and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2429160,2431160,That's the idea.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2431160,2437160,And the corners would have skylights,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2437160,2441160,and these columns would be structural.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2441160,2444160,And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2444160,2447160,"kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2447160,2449160,and create intimacy.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2449160,2454160,"Now, this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being --",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2454160,2460160,"and so I wouldn't take it literally, except the feeling of the space.",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2460160,2465160,"We studied the acoustics with laser stuff,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2465160,2468160,and they bounce them off this and see where it all works.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2468160,2470160,But you get the sense of the hall in section.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2470160,2476160,Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2476160,2478160,In this case we're opening it back up,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2478160,2481160,and getting skylights in the four corners.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2481160,2484160,And so it will be quite a different shape.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2488160,2490160,(Laughter),Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2490160,2495160,"The original building, because it was frog-like,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2495160,2498160,fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8

2503160,2506160,And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2506160,2509160,I just stuck it on there.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2509160,2514160,But this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2514160,2516160,and struggle with it and cut it away.,Sp7ZjH2IHJ8
2516160,2518160,"And of course it's not going to look like that,",Sp7ZjH2IHJ8

15948,18837,"Fifteen years ago, it was widely assumed",6zVS8HIPUng
18837,20887,that the vast majority of brain development,6zVS8HIPUng
20887,23866,takes place in the first few years of life.,6zVS8HIPUng
23866,26578,"Back then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability",6zVS8HIPUng

29199,32237,and track development across the lifespan.,6zVS8HIPUng
32237,35398,"In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances",6zVS8HIPUng
35398,37203,in brain imaging technology,6zVS8HIPUng
37203,40146,"such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,",6zVS8HIPUng
40146,43273,neuroscientists have started to look inside the living,6zVS8HIPUng
43273,45692,"human brain of all ages, and to track changes",6zVS8HIPUng
45692,48563,"in brain structure and brain function,",6zVS8HIPUng

52240,55302,"a photograph, at really high resolution of the inside",6zVS8HIPUng
55302,58522,"of the living human brain, and we can ask questions like,",6zVS8HIPUng
58522,60962,"how much gray matter does the brain contain,",6zVS8HIPUng
60962,62765,and how does that change with age?,6zVS8HIPUng
62765,66477,"And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI,",6zVS8HIPUng
66477,69872,"to take a video, a movie, of brain activity",6zVS8HIPUng
69872,72740,when participants are taking part in some kind of task,6zVS8HIPUng
72740,75632,like thinking or feeling or perceiving something.,6zVS8HIPUng
75632,78398,So many labs around the world are involved in this kind,6zVS8HIPUng
78398,80628,"of research, and we now have a really rich",6zVS8HIPUng
80628,84152,"and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops,",6zVS8HIPUng
84152,87220,and this picture has radically changed the way,6zVS8HIPUng
87220,89853,we think about human brain development,6zVS8HIPUng
89853,92621,"by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood,",6zVS8HIPUng
92621,95332,"and instead, the brain continues to develop",6zVS8HIPUng
95332,99378,right throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s.,6zVS8HIPUng
99378,103357,So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts,6zVS8HIPUng
103357,107753,"with the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty",6zVS8HIPUng
107753,111038,and ends at the age at which an individual attains,6zVS8HIPUng
111038,114489,"a stable, independent role in society.",6zVS8HIPUng
114489,116279,(Laughter),6zVS8HIPUng
116279,119044,It can go on a long time. (Laughter),6zVS8HIPUng
119044,122063,One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically,6zVS8HIPUng
122063,125327,during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.,6zVS8HIPUng
125327,128304,"So this is a model of the human brain,",6zVS8HIPUng
128304,131184,"and this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.",6zVS8HIPUng
131184,133693,Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.,6zVS8HIPUng
133693,136807,It's proportionally much bigger in humans than,6zVS8HIPUng
136807,140434,"in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of",6zVS8HIPUng
140450,143722,"high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making,",6zVS8HIPUng
143722,145812,"planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow",6zVS8HIPUng
145812,148552,"or next week or next year, inhibiting",6zVS8HIPUng
148552,151218,"inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying",6zVS8HIPUng
151218,154143,something really rude or doing something really stupid.,6zVS8HIPUng
154143,155921,"It's also involved in social interaction,",6zVS8HIPUng
155921,159045,"understanding other people, and self-awareness.",6zVS8HIPUng
159045,162095,So MRI studies looking at the development of this region,6zVS8HIPUng
162095,164565,have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development,6zVS8HIPUng
164565,167498,during the period of adolescence.,6zVS8HIPUng
167498,170456,"So if you look at gray matter volume, for example,",6zVS8HIPUng
170456,175305,gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years,6zVS8HIPUng
175305,177627,"increases during childhood, which is what you can see",6zVS8HIPUng
177627,181380,on this graph. It peaks in early adolescence.,6zVS8HIPUng
181380,183945,The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume,6zVS8HIPUng
183945,187411,in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens,6zVS8HIPUng
187411,190921,"a couple of years later in boys relative to girls,",6zVS8HIPUng
190921,192760,and that's probably because boys go through puberty,6zVS8HIPUng
192760,195012,"a couple of years later than girls on average,",6zVS8HIPUng
195012,198447,"and then during adolescence, there's a significant decline",6zVS8HIPUng
198447,201132,in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex.,6zVS8HIPUng
201132,203157,"Now that might sound bad, but actually this is",6zVS8HIPUng
203157,206307,"a really important developmental process, because",6zVS8HIPUng
206307,210413,gray matter contains cell bodies and connections,6zVS8HIPUng
210413,213867,"between cells, the synapses, and this decline",6zVS8HIPUng
213867,216612,in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex,6zVS8HIPUng
216612,219504,"is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning,",6zVS8HIPUng
219504,221827,the elimination of unwanted synapses.,6zVS8HIPUng
221827,224960,This is a really important process. It's partly dependent,6zVS8HIPUng
224960,228094,"on the environment that the animal or the human is in,",6zVS8HIPUng
228094,231538,"and the synapses that are being used are strengthened,",6zVS8HIPUng
231538,233471,and synapses that aren't being used,6zVS8HIPUng
233471,235803,in that particular environment are pruned away.,6zVS8HIPUng
235803,238309,You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.,6zVS8HIPUng
238309,241149,You prune away the weaker branches so that,6zVS8HIPUng
241149,244187,"the remaining, important branches, can grow stronger,",6zVS8HIPUng
244187,248113,"and this process, which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue",6zVS8HIPUng
248113,250780,"according to the species-specific environment,",6zVS8HIPUng
250780,253695,is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions,6zVS8HIPUng
253695,257249,during the period of human adolescence.,6zVS8HIPUng
257249,260950,So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes,6zVS8HIPUng
260950,264202,in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI,6zVS8HIPUng
264202,267475,to look at changes in brain activity across age.,6zVS8HIPUng
267475,269117,So I'll just give you an example from my lab.,6zVS8HIPUng
269117,272678,"So in my lab, we're interested in the social brain, that is",6zVS8HIPUng
272678,276262,the network of brain regions that we use to understand,6zVS8HIPUng
276262,278695,other people and to interact with other people.,6zVS8HIPUng
278695,282461,So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game,6zVS8HIPUng
282461,286868,to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.,6zVS8HIPUng
286868,288301,So this is a soccer game. (Laughter),6zVS8HIPUng
288301,290943,"Michael Owen has just missed a goal, and he's lying",6zVS8HIPUng
290943,293745,"on the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain",6zVS8HIPUng
293745,296704,that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic,6zVS8HIPUng
296704,299754,"and instinctive social emotional responses are,",6zVS8HIPUng
299754,302718,"so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal,",6zVS8HIPUng
302718,304528,everyone is doing the same thing with their arms,6zVS8HIPUng
304528,306331,"and the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen",6zVS8HIPUng
306331,308155,"as he slides along the grass, is doing the same thing",6zVS8HIPUng
308155,310424,"with his arms, and presumably has a similar",6zVS8HIPUng
310424,312398,"facial expression, and the only people who don't",6zVS8HIPUng
312398,315859,are the guys in yellow at the back — (Laughs) —,6zVS8HIPUng
315859,318402,"and I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium,",6zVS8HIPUng
318402,320697,and they're doing another social emotional response,6zVS8HIPUng
320697,323332,"that we all instantly recognize, and that's the second aspect",6zVS8HIPUng
323332,326968,"of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates,",6zVS8HIPUng
326968,330350,"how good we are at reading other people's behavior,",6zVS8HIPUng
330350,333027,"their actions, their gestures, their facial expressions,",6zVS8HIPUng
333027,336843,in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states.,6zVS8HIPUng
336843,338620,So you don't have to ask any of these guys.,6zVS8HIPUng
338620,341161,You have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling,6zVS8HIPUng
341161,343749,and thinking at this precise moment in time.,6zVS8HIPUng
343749,345505,So that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab.,6zVS8HIPUng
345505,349077,"So in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab",6zVS8HIPUng
349093,351478,"to have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task",6zVS8HIPUng
351478,354772,"that involves thinking about other people, their minds,",6zVS8HIPUng
354772,357666,"their mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings",6zVS8HIPUng
357666,360512,"that we've found several times now, as have other labs",6zVS8HIPUng
360512,363730,"around the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called",6zVS8HIPUng
363730,366948,"medial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide,",6zVS8HIPUng
366948,369704,and it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex,6zVS8HIPUng
369704,372102,in the midline of your head.,6zVS8HIPUng
372102,375385,This region is more active in adolescents when they make,6zVS8HIPUng
375385,377512,these social decisions and think about other people,6zVS8HIPUng
377512,380313,"than it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis",6zVS8HIPUng
380313,383553,of nine different studies in this area from labs around,6zVS8HIPUng
383553,386253,"the world, and they all show the same thing, that activity",6zVS8HIPUng
386253,389623,in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases,6zVS8HIPUng
389623,392070,during the period of adolescence.,6zVS8HIPUng
392070,394714,And we think that might be because adolescents and adults,6zVS8HIPUng
394714,397080,"use a different mental approach, a different",6zVS8HIPUng
397080,400498,"cognitive strategy, to make social decisions,",6zVS8HIPUng
400498,404014,and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies,6zVS8HIPUng
404014,405991,whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them,6zVS8HIPUng
405991,408535,"some kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you",6zVS8HIPUng
408535,411745,another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab.,6zVS8HIPUng
411745,414393,So imagine that you're the participant in one of our,6zVS8HIPUng
414393,416118,"experiments. You come into the lab,",6zVS8HIPUng
416118,418792,you see this computerized task.,6zVS8HIPUng
418792,421582,"In this task, you see a set of shelves.",6zVS8HIPUng
421582,424399,"Now, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them,",6zVS8HIPUng
424399,427370,and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set,6zVS8HIPUng
427370,430955,"of shelves, and there are some objects that he can't see.",6zVS8HIPUng
430955,433234,"They're occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of",6zVS8HIPUng
433234,435878,gray piece of wood.,6zVS8HIPUng
435878,439362,This is the same set of shelves from his point of view.,6zVS8HIPUng
439362,442855,"Notice that there are only some objects that he can see,",6zVS8HIPUng
442855,445307,whereas there are many more objects that you can see.,6zVS8HIPUng
445307,447503,Now your task is to move objects around.,6zVS8HIPUng
447503,449865,"The director, standing behind the set of shelves,",6zVS8HIPUng
449865,452610,"is going to direct you to move objects around,",6zVS8HIPUng
452610,454504,"but remember, he's not going to ask you to move objects",6zVS8HIPUng
454504,458224,that he can't see. This introduces a really interesting,6zVS8HIPUng
458224,460417,condition whereby there's a kind of conflict,6zVS8HIPUng
460417,463585,between your perspective and the director's perspective.,6zVS8HIPUng
463585,466825,So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left.,6zVS8HIPUng
466825,468856,There are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively,6zVS8HIPUng
468871,471021,"go for the white truck, because that's the top truck",6zVS8HIPUng
471021,473839,"from your perspective, but then you have to remember,",6zVS8HIPUng
473839,475898,"Oh, he can't see that truck, so he must mean""",6zVS8HIPUng
475898,478655,"me to move the blue truck, which is the top truck""",6zVS8HIPUng
478655,481300,"from his perspective. Now believe it or not,",6zVS8HIPUng
481300,484251,"normal, healthy, intelligent adults like you make errors",6zVS8HIPUng
484251,487391,about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial.,6zVS8HIPUng
487391,490234,They move the white truck instead of the blue truck.,6zVS8HIPUng
490234,493550,"So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults,",6zVS8HIPUng
493550,495104,and we also have a control condition,6zVS8HIPUng
495104,499165,where there's no director and instead we give people a rule.,6zVS8HIPUng
499165,501079,"We tell them, okay, we're going to do exactly the same thing",6zVS8HIPUng
501079,503916,but this time there's no director. Instead you've got to,6zVS8HIPUng
503916,507123,ignore objects with the dark gray background.,6zVS8HIPUng
507123,509823,"You'll see that this is exactly the same condition, only",6zVS8HIPUng
509823,512669,in the no-director condition they just have to remember,6zVS8HIPUng
512669,515740,"to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas",6zVS8HIPUng
515740,517420,"in the director condition, they have to remember",6zVS8HIPUng
517420,520961,to take into account the director's perspective,6zVS8HIPUng
520961,525258,in order to guide their ongoing behavior.,6zVS8HIPUng
525258,527868,"Okay, so if I just show you the percentage errors",6zVS8HIPUng
527868,530434,"in a large developmental study we did,",6zVS8HIPUng
530434,533988,"this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood,",6zVS8HIPUng
533988,535198,and what you're going to see is the percentage errors,6zVS8HIPUng
535198,537172,"in the adult group in both conditions,",6zVS8HIPUng
537187,540458,"so the gray is the director condition, and you see",6zVS8HIPUng
540458,543031,that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent,6zVS8HIPUng

550855,553523,"Developmentally, these two conditions develop",6zVS8HIPUng
553523,556446,in exactly the same way. Between late childhood,6zVS8HIPUng
556446,558687,"and mid-adolescence, there's an improvement,",6zVS8HIPUng
558687,562038,"in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials,",6zVS8HIPUng
562038,563158,in both of these conditions.,6zVS8HIPUng
563158,565443,"But it's when you compare the last two groups,",6zVS8HIPUng
565443,567395,the mid-adolescent group and the adult group,6zVS8HIPUng
567395,570555,"where things get really interesting, because there, there is",6zVS8HIPUng
570555,573593,no continued improvement in the no-director condition.,6zVS8HIPUng
573593,576523,"In other words, everything you need to do in order to",6zVS8HIPUng
576523,579229,remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed,6zVS8HIPUng
579229,581760,"by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast,",6zVS8HIPUng
581760,584157,"if you look at the last two gray bars, there's still",6zVS8HIPUng
584157,587307,a significant improvement in the director condition,6zVS8HIPUng
587307,589748,"between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what",6zVS8HIPUng
589748,593124,this means is that the ability to take into account someone,6zVS8HIPUng
593124,596409,"else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior,",6zVS8HIPUng

598668,603274,"the time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence.",6zVS8HIPUng
603274,605814,So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you,6zVS8HIPUng
605814,608223,sometimes think they have problems taking other people's,6zVS8HIPUng
608223,611979,"perspectives, you're right. They do. And this is why.",6zVS8HIPUng
611979,615492,So we sometimes laugh about teenagers.,6zVS8HIPUng
615492,619355,"They're parodied, sometimes even demonized in the media",6zVS8HIPUng
619355,622882,"for their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks,",6zVS8HIPUng
622882,625653,"they're sometimes moody, they're very self-conscious.",6zVS8HIPUng
625653,628146,I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine,6zVS8HIPUng
628146,630633,who said that the thing he noticed most,6zVS8HIPUng
630633,633614,about his teenage daughters before and after puberty,6zVS8HIPUng
633614,635858,was their level of embarrassment in front of him.,6zVS8HIPUng
635874,638363,"So, he said, Before puberty, if my two daughters""",6zVS8HIPUng
638363,640617,"were messing around in a shop, I'd say, 'Hey,",6zVS8HIPUng
640617,642366,"stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song,'",6zVS8HIPUng
642366,644267,and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing,6zVS8HIPUng
644267,647738,"their favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat.",6zVS8HIPUng
647738,649555,(Laughter),6zVS8HIPUng
649555,653032,The very notion of their dad singing in public,6zVS8HIPUng
653032,655395,was enough to make them behave.,6zVS8HIPUng
655395,656823,"So people often ask,",6zVS8HIPUng
656823,659456,"Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?""",6zVS8HIPUng
659456,661578,"Is it something we've invented recently in the West?""
231;661578;664246;And actually, the answer is probably not. There are lots""",6zVS8HIPUng
664246,667669,of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound,6zVS8HIPUng
667669,669826,very similar to the descriptions we use today.,6zVS8HIPUng
669826,674059,"So there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from The Winter's Tale""""",6zVS8HIPUng
674059,676834,where he describes adolescence as follows:,6zVS8HIPUng
676834,679680,"I would there were no age between ten and""",6zVS8HIPUng
679680,682920,"three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest;",6zVS8HIPUng
682920,685011,for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches,6zVS8HIPUng
685011,691234,"with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting. (Laughter)""",6zVS8HIPUng
691234,695768,"He then goes on to say, Having said that, would any""",6zVS8HIPUng
695768,698913,but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty,6zVS8HIPUng
698913,701411,"hunt in this weather? (Laughter)""",6zVS8HIPUng
701411,704337,"So almost 400 years ago, Shakespeare was portraying",6zVS8HIPUng
704337,707061,adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we,6zVS8HIPUng
707061,710520,"portray them in today, but today we try to understand",6zVS8HIPUng
710520,713607,their behavior in terms of the underlying changes,6zVS8HIPUng
713607,715545,that are going on in their brain.,6zVS8HIPUng
715545,719153,"So for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents",6zVS8HIPUng
719153,721478,have a tendency to take risks. They do.,6zVS8HIPUng
721478,724110,"They take more risks than children or adults,",6zVS8HIPUng
724110,726570,and they are particularly prone to taking risks,6zVS8HIPUng
726570,729538,when they're with their friends. There's an important drive,6zVS8HIPUng
729538,732024,to become independent from one's parents,6zVS8HIPUng
732024,734848,and to impress one's friends in adolescence.,6zVS8HIPUng
734848,737447,But now we try to understand that in terms of,6zVS8HIPUng
737447,740440,"the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system,",6zVS8HIPUng
740440,742983,so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red,6zVS8HIPUng
742983,744848,"in the slide behind me, and also on this brain.",6zVS8HIPUng
744848,747957,"So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain,",6zVS8HIPUng
747957,751690,and it's involved in things like emotion processing,6zVS8HIPUng
751690,754840,and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling,6zVS8HIPUng
754840,758136,"out of doing fun things, including taking risks.",6zVS8HIPUng
758136,760501,It gives you the kick out of taking risks.,6zVS8HIPUng
760501,763549,"And this region, the regions within the limbic system,",6zVS8HIPUng
763549,766968,have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding,6zVS8HIPUng
766968,770737,"feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults,",6zVS8HIPUng
770737,774439,"and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex,",6zVS8HIPUng
774439,776713,"which you can see in blue in the slide here,",6zVS8HIPUng
776713,779580,"which stops us taking excessive risks,",6zVS8HIPUng
779580,782978,is still very much in development in adolescents.,6zVS8HIPUng
782978,786645,So brain research has shown that the adolescent brain,6zVS8HIPUng
786645,789987,"undergoes really quite profound development,",6zVS8HIPUng
789987,793943,"and this has implications for education, for rehabilitation,",6zVS8HIPUng
793943,797963,"and intervention. The environment, including teaching,",6zVS8HIPUng
797963,801372,"can and does shape the developing adolescent brain,",6zVS8HIPUng
801372,804174,and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been,6zVS8HIPUng
804174,806679,routinely educating teenagers in the West.,6zVS8HIPUng
806679,810432,"All four of my grandparents, for example, left school",6zVS8HIPUng
810432,814266,in their early adolescence. They had no choice.,6zVS8HIPUng
814266,817040,"And that's still the case for many, many teenagers",6zVS8HIPUng
817040,820207,around the world today. Forty percent of teenagers,6zVS8HIPUng
820207,824429,don't have access to secondary school education.,6zVS8HIPUng
824429,827068,"And yet, this is a period of life where the brain is",6zVS8HIPUng
827068,829915,particularly adaptable and malleable.,6zVS8HIPUng
829915,833685,It's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity.,6zVS8HIPUng
833685,835918,So what's sometimes seen as the problem,6zVS8HIPUng
835918,838394,"with adolescents — heightened risk-taking, poor impulse",6zVS8HIPUng
838394,842336,"control, self-consciousness — shouldn't be stigmatized.",6zVS8HIPUng
842336,845173,It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide,6zVS8HIPUng
845173,848087,an excellent opportunity for education,6zVS8HIPUng
848087,852517,and social development. Thank you. (Applause),6zVS8HIPUng

39260,41260,I'd be extremely surprised,y6MC4iXhT6I
41260,44260,if you didn't recognize many or most of them.,y6MC4iXhT6I

49260,51260,"In fact, they're so well-known",y6MC4iXhT6I
51260,53260,that you might even recognize them,y6MC4iXhT6I
53260,56260,in a slightly or somewhat different form.,y6MC4iXhT6I
57260,59260,(Laughter),y6MC4iXhT6I
60260,62260,But I think we're looking for something more.,y6MC4iXhT6I
62260,64260,We're looking for something more.,y6MC4iXhT6I
64260,66260,We're looking for images that shine,y6MC4iXhT6I
66260,69260,"an uncompromising light on crucial issues,",y6MC4iXhT6I
69260,72260,"images that transcend borders, that transcend religions,",y6MC4iXhT6I
72260,74260,images that provoke us,y6MC4iXhT6I
74260,76260,to step up and do something --,y6MC4iXhT6I
76260,78260,"in other words, to act.",y6MC4iXhT6I
78260,81260,"Well, this image you've all seen.",y6MC4iXhT6I
81260,83260,It changed our view of the physical world.,y6MC4iXhT6I

132260,135260,"Well, I think what is far worse",y6MC4iXhT6I
135260,137260,is man's destructive power over man.,y6MC4iXhT6I

299160,302160,"And actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
302160,306160,a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
306160,309160,"And again, I kept on going, looking for more reference,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
309160,312160,"every bit of reference I could find -- drawings, beautiful photos.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
312160,315160,This guy -- I love this guy! He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner,rEg-ZNB3qyI
315160,317160,with a ruler.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
317160,319160,"This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
319160,321160,and I,rEg-ZNB3qyI
321160,323160,replicated every last bone and put it in.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
323160,326160,"And after about six weeks,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
326160,329160,"I finished, painted, mounted",rEg-ZNB3qyI
329160,332160,my own dodo skeleton.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
334160,336160,You can see that I even made a museum label for it,rEg-ZNB3qyI
336160,338160,that includes a brief history of the dodo.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
338160,340160,And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn't photograph it --,rEg-ZNB3qyI
340160,342160,a museum vitrine.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
342160,344160,"I don't have the room for this in my house,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
344160,347160,but I had to finish what I had started.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
347160,350160,And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
350160,352160,"Again, like I said, my life has been about",rEg-ZNB3qyI
352160,354160,"being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
354160,357160,"and also making them for myself, obtaining them,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
357160,360160,appreciating them and diving into them.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
360160,362160,"And in this folder, Creative Projects,""""",rEg-ZNB3qyI
362160,365160,"there are tons of projects that I'm currently working on,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
365160,368160,"projects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
368160,371160,and things that I may just want to find and buy and have,rEg-ZNB3qyI
371160,373160,and look at and touch.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
373160,376160,But now there was potentially this new category of things,rEg-ZNB3qyI
376160,378160,that I could sculpt,rEg-ZNB3qyI
378160,380160,"that was different, that I -- you know,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
380160,382160,"I have my own R2D2, but that's --",rEg-ZNB3qyI
382160,385160,"honestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
385160,388160,"And so I went back and looked through my Creative Projects"" folder,""",rEg-ZNB3qyI
388160,391160,and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
392160,395160,"Now, this is funny for me:",rEg-ZNB3qyI
395160,398160,"to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
398160,400160,"because if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
400160,403160,"Chandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
403160,405160,"But in this case,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
405160,409160,"it's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
409160,411160,it's about the object in and of itself.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
411160,414160,"And in this case, this object is --",rEg-ZNB3qyI
414160,417160,plays on a host of levels.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
417160,419160,"First of all, there's the object in the world.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
419160,421160,"This is the Kniphausen Hawk.""""",rEg-ZNB3qyI
421160,423160,It is a ceremonial pouring vessel,rEg-ZNB3qyI
423160,427160,"made around 1700 for a Swedish Count,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
427160,429160,and it is very likely the object from which,rEg-ZNB3qyI
429160,432160,Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
432160,435160,"Then there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
435160,437160,"Built out of words, it is the engine",rEg-ZNB3qyI
437160,440160,"that drives the plot of his book and also the movie,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
440160,442160,in which another object is created:,rEg-ZNB3qyI
442160,445160,"a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
445160,449160,"inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
449160,451160,"And then there is this fourth level, which is",rEg-ZNB3qyI
451160,453160,a whole new object in the world:,rEg-ZNB3qyI
453160,456160,"the prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
456160,458160,"becomes, in its own right,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
458160,460160,"a whole other thing,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
460160,462160,a whole new object of desire.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
462160,464160,And so now it was time to do some research.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
464160,466160,I actually had done some research,rEg-ZNB3qyI
466160,468160,a few years before -- it's why the folder was there.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
468160,470160,"I'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
470160,472160,"of the Maltese Falcon on eBay,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
472160,474160,and had downloaded enough pictures to actually,rEg-ZNB3qyI
474160,476160,have some reasonable reference.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
476160,478160,"But I discovered,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
478160,480160,"in researching further,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
480160,483160,"really wanting precise reference, that",rEg-ZNB3qyI
483160,485160,one of the original lead birds,rEg-ZNB3qyI
485160,487160,"had been sold at Christie's in 1994,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
487160,490160,and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller,rEg-ZNB3qyI
490160,492160,"who had the original Christie's catalogue,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
492160,494160,"and in it I found this magnificent picture,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
494160,496160,which included a size reference.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
496160,500160,"I was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
500160,502160,"I found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
502160,504160,"a New Jersey editor, actually found this",rEg-ZNB3qyI
504160,506160,resin Maltese Falcon,rEg-ZNB3qyI
506160,509160,"at a flea market in 1991,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
509160,511160,although it took him five years,rEg-ZNB3qyI
511160,513160,to authenticate this bird to,rEg-ZNB3qyI
513160,515160,"the auctioneers' specifications,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
515160,517160,because there was a lot of controversy about it.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
517160,519160,"It was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props",rEg-ZNB3qyI
519160,521160,about the time the movie was made.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
521160,523160,"It's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
523160,525160,"because I can see it compared to this thing,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
525160,527160,"and I can tell you -- it's real, it's the real thing,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
527160,530160,it's made from the exact same mold that this one is.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
530160,533160,"In this one, because the auction was actually so controversial,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
533160,535160,"Profiles in History, the auction house that sold this --",rEg-ZNB3qyI
535160,537160,"I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars --",rEg-ZNB3qyI
537160,540160,they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom --,rEg-ZNB3qyI
540160,542160,"not just a front elevation, but also",rEg-ZNB3qyI
542160,544160,"a side, rear",rEg-ZNB3qyI
544160,546160,and other side elevation.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
546160,549160,"So now, I had all the topology I needed",rEg-ZNB3qyI
549160,551160,to replicate the Maltese Falcon.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
551160,554160,"What do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don't know.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
554160,556160,"So what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
556160,559160,"I blew all my reference up to full size,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
559160,561160,and then I began cutting out the negatives and using,rEg-ZNB3qyI
561160,563160,those templates as shape references.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
563160,565160,"So I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
565160,568160,"and I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
568160,571160,"And then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
571160,573160,I worked out and achieved --,rEg-ZNB3qyI
573160,575160,working in front of the television and Super Sculpey --,rEg-ZNB3qyI
575160,577160,here's me sitting next to my wife --,rEg-ZNB3qyI
577160,580160,it's the only picture I took of the entire process.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
580160,582160,"As I moved through, I achieved",rEg-ZNB3qyI
582160,584160,a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
584160,586160,"But again, I am not a sculptor,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
586160,588160,"and so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
589160,592160,"I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey;",rEg-ZNB3qyI
592160,594160,I certainly wasn't able to get it.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
594160,596160,"So, I went down to my shop,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
596160,599160,"and I molded it and I cast it in resin,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
599160,602160,"because in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
602160,605160,Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
605160,608160,My preference is about 70 coats of this --,rEg-ZNB3qyI
608160,610160,matte black auto primer.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
610160,613160,"I spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
613160,616160,"but it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surface",rEg-ZNB3qyI
616160,618160,and I can get it glass-smooth.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
618160,620160,"Oh, finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
620160,623160,"Now, the great thing about getting it to this point was that",rEg-ZNB3qyI
623160,625160,"because in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
625160,628160,"and they place it on the table, they actually spin it.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
628160,630160,So I was able to actually,rEg-ZNB3qyI
630160,633160,screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
633160,636160,And I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light,rEg-ZNB3qyI
636160,639160,"in the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it --",rEg-ZNB3qyI
639160,642160,that's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
642160,645160,I ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
645160,647160,And it's beautiful. And I can state with authority,rEg-ZNB3qyI
647160,649160,"at this point in time, when I'd finished it,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
649160,652160,of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few --,rEg-ZNB3qyI
652160,654160,this is by far the most accurate,rEg-ZNB3qyI
654160,656160,representation of the original Maltese Falcon,rEg-ZNB3qyI
656160,659160,"than anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
659160,661160,is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
661160,664160,This is where it gets weird.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
664160,667160,"Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
667160,669160,Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer,rEg-ZNB3qyI
669160,671160,of the Black Dahlia.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
671160,673160,"Now, James Ellroy believes",rEg-ZNB3qyI
673160,676160,"that Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
676160,678160,killed James Elroy's mother.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
678160,681160,"I'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
681160,684160,"during the production of a weird comedy sequel to The Maltese Falcon,""""",rEg-ZNB3qyI
684160,686160,"called The Black Bird,"" starring George Segal,""",rEg-ZNB3qyI
686160,688160,the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,rEg-ZNB3qyI

690160,693160,"one of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie --",rEg-ZNB3qyI
693160,695160,stolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought,rEg-ZNB3qyI
695160,697160,it was a publicity stunt for the movie.,rEg-ZNB3qyI

705160,707160,"who played Wilmer Cook in the movie,",rEg-ZNB3qyI

709160,712160,one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
712160,715160,"And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
715160,717160,until it got stolen,rEg-ZNB3qyI
717160,720160,in January of 2007.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
720160,722160,It would seem that the object of desire,rEg-ZNB3qyI
722160,725160,only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
725160,727160,"So here I had this Falcon,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
727160,729160,"and it was lovely. It looked really great,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
729160,731160,"the light worked on it really well,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
731160,733160,it was better than anything that I could achieve,rEg-ZNB3qyI
733160,735160,or obtain out in the world.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
735160,738160,But there was a problem. And the problem was that:,rEg-ZNB3qyI
739160,741160,"I wanted the entirety of the object,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
741160,744160,I wanted the weight behind the object.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
744160,746160,This thing was made of resin and it was too light.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
746160,748160,There's this group online that I frequent.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
748160,751160,It's a group of prop crazies just like me,rEg-ZNB3qyI
751160,753160,"called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
753160,756160,make and travel in information about movie props.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
756160,758160,"And it turned out that one of the guys there,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
758160,761160,"a friend of mine that I never actually met,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
761160,763160,"but befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
763160,766160,"He took my master Falcon pattern,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
766160,768160,he actually did lost wax casting,rEg-ZNB3qyI
768160,770160,"in bronze for me,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
770160,772160,and this is the bronze I got back.,rEg-ZNB3qyI

790160,792160,"how obsessed I am. This project's only for me,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
792160,795160,and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay,rEg-ZNB3qyI
795160,798160,"a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
798160,801160,in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...,rEg-ZNB3qyI

815160,818160,"There you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
818160,821160,"That's half the weight of my dog, Huxley.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
822160,825160,But there's a problem.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
825160,828160,"Now, here's the most recent progression of Falcons.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
828160,831160,On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
831160,833160,"There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
833160,836160,"because I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
836160,838160,there's my master and there's my bronze.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
838160,841160,"There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
841160,843160,"which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
843160,846160,"you lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.",rEg-ZNB3qyI
846160,849160,"And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one,",rEg-ZNB3qyI
849160,852160,it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.,rEg-ZNB3qyI
852160,855160,"Yeah, no, really, this was like aah --",rEg-ZNB3qyI
856160,858160,why didn't I remember this?,rEg-ZNB3qyI
858160,861160,Why didn't I start and make it bigger?,rEg-ZNB3qyI
861160,864160,So what do I do? I figure I have two options.,rEg-ZNB3qyI

25641,28665,"had happened in Europe and the rest of the world,",qsJYrwzfd6w
28665,31254,but Africa was sort of cut off.,qsJYrwzfd6w
31254,33881,"And that changed, first with ships",qsJYrwzfd6w
33881,37158,"when we had the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution",qsJYrwzfd6w
37158,39259,and also the Industrial Revolution.,qsJYrwzfd6w
39259,42286,And now we've got the digital revolution.,qsJYrwzfd6w
42286,45286,These revolutions have not been evenly distributed,qsJYrwzfd6w
45286,47619,across continents and nations.,qsJYrwzfd6w
47619,50349,Never have been.,qsJYrwzfd6w

54114,57018,that connect Africa to the rest of the world.,qsJYrwzfd6w
57018,59058,What I find amazing is that Africa,qsJYrwzfd6w
59058,61868,is transcending its geography problem.,qsJYrwzfd6w
61868,63682,Africa is connecting to the rest of the world,qsJYrwzfd6w

68794,70995,but some barriers remain.,qsJYrwzfd6w
70995,74683,It is with this context that Ushahidi came to be.,qsJYrwzfd6w
74683,79219,"In 2008, one of the problems that we faced",qsJYrwzfd6w
79219,81757,was lack of information flow.,qsJYrwzfd6w
81757,84053,"There was a media blackout in 2008,",qsJYrwzfd6w
84053,86429,when there was post-election violence in Kenya.,qsJYrwzfd6w
86429,89253,It was a very tragic time. It was a very difficult time.,qsJYrwzfd6w
89253,92003,So we came together and we created software,qsJYrwzfd6w
92003,93569,called Ushahidi.,qsJYrwzfd6w
93569,97169,"And Ushahidi means testimony"" or ""witness"" in Swahili.""",qsJYrwzfd6w
97169,100339,I'm very lucky to work with two amazing collaborators.,qsJYrwzfd6w
100339,102445,This is David and Erik.,qsJYrwzfd6w

104517,107529,Clearly I have a German mother somewhere.,qsJYrwzfd6w
107529,110118,And we worked together first with building,qsJYrwzfd6w
110118,111566,and growing Ushahidi.,qsJYrwzfd6w
111566,114565,And the idea of the software was to gather information,qsJYrwzfd6w
114565,117338,"from SMS, email and web, and put a map",qsJYrwzfd6w
117338,120253,"so that you could see what was happening where,",qsJYrwzfd6w
120253,122357,and you could visualize that data.,qsJYrwzfd6w
122357,124613,"And after that initial prototype,",qsJYrwzfd6w
124613,127108,we set out to make free and open-source software,qsJYrwzfd6w
127108,131959,so that others do not have to start from scratch like we did.,qsJYrwzfd6w
131959,133930,"All the while, we also wanted to give back",qsJYrwzfd6w
133930,136162,to the local tech community that helped us,qsJYrwzfd6w
136162,139667,grow Ushahidi and supported us in those early days.,qsJYrwzfd6w
139667,142250,"And that's why we set up the iHub in Nairobi,",qsJYrwzfd6w
142250,144274,an actual physical space,qsJYrwzfd6w
144274,146740,"where we could collaborate,",qsJYrwzfd6w
146740,151297,and it is now part of an integral tech ecosystem in Kenya.,qsJYrwzfd6w
151297,154067,We did that with the support of different organizations,qsJYrwzfd6w
154067,157072,like the MacArthur Foundation and Omidyar Network.,qsJYrwzfd6w
157072,160249,"And we were able to grow this software footprint,",qsJYrwzfd6w
160249,163015,and a few years later it became,qsJYrwzfd6w
163015,165712,"very useful software,",qsJYrwzfd6w
165712,168939,and we were quite humbled when it was used in Haiti,qsJYrwzfd6w
168939,172008,where citizens could indicate where they are,qsJYrwzfd6w
172008,173402,"and what their needs were,",qsJYrwzfd6w
173402,176699,and also to deal with the fallout from the nuclear crisis,qsJYrwzfd6w

178738,182132,"Now, this year the Internet turns 20,",qsJYrwzfd6w

187215,190272,"It is the team, and it's also the community",qsJYrwzfd6w
190272,194557,that uses this technology in ways that we could not foresee.,qsJYrwzfd6w
194557,197877,We did not imagine that there would be this many maps,qsJYrwzfd6w

212609,215960,trying to figure out the different issues that they're dealing with.,qsJYrwzfd6w

399251,402160,So why don't we leverage that? And that's why we built this.,qsJYrwzfd6w
402160,404358,The other reason that we built this,qsJYrwzfd6w
404358,406944,"is when electricity goes down, this has eight hours",qsJYrwzfd6w

419701,422437,The software sensibility at Ushahidi is still at play,qsJYrwzfd6w
422437,425496,when we wondered how can we use the cloud,qsJYrwzfd6w
425496,427438,to be more intelligent so that,qsJYrwzfd6w
427438,429823,"you can analyze the different networks,",qsJYrwzfd6w

432962,435471,"you pick on the fastest network,",qsJYrwzfd6w

446729,449144,then you hop onto the next one.,qsJYrwzfd6w

452881,455769,"With load balancing, this can be possible.",qsJYrwzfd6w
455769,459622,The other interesting thing for us -- we like sensors --,qsJYrwzfd6w
459622,463050,is this idea that you could have an on-ramp,qsJYrwzfd6w
463050,464977,for the Internet of things.,qsJYrwzfd6w
464977,468597,Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this.,qsJYrwzfd6w
468597,471336,It's built in a modular way so that you can also attach,qsJYrwzfd6w

487494,489750,"And for us, we begin with solving the problem",qsJYrwzfd6w
489750,492694,in our own backyard in Kenya.,qsJYrwzfd6w
492694,495094,It is not without challenge.,qsJYrwzfd6w
495094,497847,Our team has basically been mules carrying components,qsJYrwzfd6w
497847,501041,from the U.S. to Kenya. We've had very interesting conversations,qsJYrwzfd6w

125260,128260,that of this tiny worm.,HA7GwKXfJB0
128260,130260,Its modest nervous system,HA7GwKXfJB0
130260,132260,consists of just 300 neurons.,HA7GwKXfJB0
132260,134260,"And in the 1970s and '80s,",HA7GwKXfJB0
134260,136260,a team of scientists,HA7GwKXfJB0
136260,138260,"mapped all 7,000 connections",HA7GwKXfJB0

141260,143260,"In this diagram, every node is a neuron,",HA7GwKXfJB0

145260,147260,This is the connectome,HA7GwKXfJB0
147260,151260,of the worm C. elegans.,HA7GwKXfJB0
151260,154260,Your connectome is far more complex than this,HA7GwKXfJB0
154260,156260,because your brain,HA7GwKXfJB0
156260,158260,contains 100 billion neurons,HA7GwKXfJB0
158260,161260,"and 10,000 times as many connections.",HA7GwKXfJB0
161260,163260,"There's a diagram like this for your brain,",HA7GwKXfJB0
163260,166260,but there's no way it would fit on this slide.,HA7GwKXfJB0
167260,170260,Your connectome contains one million times more connections,HA7GwKXfJB0
170260,173260,than your genome has letters.,HA7GwKXfJB0
173260,175260,That's a lot of information.,HA7GwKXfJB0
175260,178260,What's in that information?,HA7GwKXfJB0
179260,182260,"We don't know for sure, but there are theories.",HA7GwKXfJB0
182260,185260,"Since the 19th century, neuroscientists have speculated",HA7GwKXfJB0
185260,187260,that maybe your memories --,HA7GwKXfJB0
187260,189260,"the information that makes you, you --",HA7GwKXfJB0
189260,191260,maybe your memories are stored,HA7GwKXfJB0
191260,193260,in the connections between your brain's neurons.,HA7GwKXfJB0
195260,197260,And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity --,HA7GwKXfJB0
197260,200260,maybe your personality and your intellect --,HA7GwKXfJB0
200260,202260,maybe they're also encoded,HA7GwKXfJB0
202260,205260,in the connections between your neurons.,HA7GwKXfJB0
206260,209260,And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis:,HA7GwKXfJB0
209260,212260,I am my connectome.,HA7GwKXfJB0
212260,215260,I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true;,HA7GwKXfJB0
215260,217260,I just want you to remember it.,HA7GwKXfJB0
217260,219260,"And in fact, we don't know if this hypothesis is correct,",HA7GwKXfJB0
219260,221260,because we have never had technologies,HA7GwKXfJB0
221260,223260,powerful enough to test it.,HA7GwKXfJB0
224260,227260,Finding that worm connectome,HA7GwKXfJB0
227260,230260,took over a dozen years of tedious labor.,HA7GwKXfJB0
230260,233260,"And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own,",HA7GwKXfJB0
233260,236260,"we need more sophisticated technologies, that are automated,",HA7GwKXfJB0
236260,239260,that will speed up the process of finding connectomes.,HA7GwKXfJB0
239260,242260,"And in the next few minutes, I'll tell you about some of these technologies,",HA7GwKXfJB0
242260,244260,which are currently under development,HA7GwKXfJB0
244260,247260,in my lab and the labs of my collaborators.,HA7GwKXfJB0
248260,251260,Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before.,HA7GwKXfJB0
251260,253260,You can recognize them instantly,HA7GwKXfJB0
253260,256260,by their fantastic shapes.,HA7GwKXfJB0
256260,259260,"They extend long and delicate branches,",HA7GwKXfJB0
259260,262260,"and in short, they look like trees.",HA7GwKXfJB0
262260,265260,But this is just a single neuron.,HA7GwKXfJB0
265260,267260,"In order to find connectomes,",HA7GwKXfJB0
267260,270260,we have to see all the neurons at the same time.,HA7GwKXfJB0
270260,272260,"So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri,",HA7GwKXfJB0
272260,274260,who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman,HA7GwKXfJB0
274260,276260,at Harvard University.,HA7GwKXfJB0
276260,278260,Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices,HA7GwKXfJB0
278260,280260,of a mouse brain.,HA7GwKXfJB0
280260,283260,"And we're zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times",HA7GwKXfJB0
284260,286260,"to obtain the resolution,",HA7GwKXfJB0
286260,289260,so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time.,HA7GwKXfJB0
290260,293260,"Except, you still may not really recognize them,",HA7GwKXfJB0
293260,296260,and that's because we have to work in three dimensions.,HA7GwKXfJB0
296260,298260,If we take many images of many slices of the brain,HA7GwKXfJB0
298260,300260,"and stack them up,",HA7GwKXfJB0
300260,302260,we get a three-dimensional image.,HA7GwKXfJB0
302260,304260,"And still, you may not see the branches.",HA7GwKXfJB0
304260,306260,"So we start at the top,",HA7GwKXfJB0
306260,309260,"and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red,",HA7GwKXfJB0
309260,311260,and we do that for the next slice,HA7GwKXfJB0
311260,313260,and for the next slice.,HA7GwKXfJB0
313260,315260,"And we keep on doing that,",HA7GwKXfJB0
315260,318260,slice after slice.,HA7GwKXfJB0
318260,320260,"If we continue through the entire stack,",HA7GwKXfJB0
320260,323260,we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape,HA7GwKXfJB0
323260,326260,of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron.,HA7GwKXfJB0
326260,328260,And we can do that for another neuron in green.,HA7GwKXfJB0
328260,330260,And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron,HA7GwKXfJB0
330260,332260,"at two locations,",HA7GwKXfJB0
332260,334260,and these are what are called synapses.,HA7GwKXfJB0
334260,336260,"Let's zoom in on one synapse,",HA7GwKXfJB0
336260,339260,and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron.,HA7GwKXfJB0
339260,341260,You should see small circles --,HA7GwKXfJB0
341260,344260,these are called vesicles.,HA7GwKXfJB0
344260,347260,They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.,HA7GwKXfJB0
347260,349260,"And so when the green neuron wants to communicate,",HA7GwKXfJB0
349260,351260,"it wants to send a message to the red neuron,",HA7GwKXfJB0
351260,354260,it spits out neurotransmitter.,HA7GwKXfJB0
354260,356260,"At the synapse, the two neurons",HA7GwKXfJB0
356260,358260,are said to be connected,HA7GwKXfJB0
358260,361260,like two friends talking on the telephone.,HA7GwKXfJB0
362260,364260,So you see how to find a synapse.,HA7GwKXfJB0
364260,367260,How can we find an entire connectome?,HA7GwKXfJB0
367260,370260,"Well, we take this three-dimensional stack of images",HA7GwKXfJB0
370260,373260,and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book.,HA7GwKXfJB0
373260,376260,"We color every neuron in, in a different color,",HA7GwKXfJB0
376260,378260,"and then we look through all of the images,",HA7GwKXfJB0
378260,380260,find the synapses,HA7GwKXfJB0
380260,383260,and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse.,HA7GwKXfJB0
383260,386260,"If we can do that throughout all the images,",HA7GwKXfJB0
386260,388260,we could find a connectome.,HA7GwKXfJB0
389260,391260,"Now, at this point,",HA7GwKXfJB0
391260,393260,you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses.,HA7GwKXfJB0
393260,395260,And so I think we're ready to tackle,HA7GwKXfJB0
395260,398260,one of the most important questions in neuroscience:,HA7GwKXfJB0
399260,402260,how are the brains of men and women different?,HA7GwKXfJB0
402260,404260,(Laughter),HA7GwKXfJB0
404260,406260,"According to this self-help book,",HA7GwKXfJB0
406260,408260,guys brains are like waffles;,HA7GwKXfJB0
408260,411260,they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes.,HA7GwKXfJB0
411260,414260,Girls' brains are like spaghetti;,HA7GwKXfJB0
414260,417260,everything in their life is connected to everything else.,HA7GwKXfJB0
417260,419260,(Laughter),HA7GwKXfJB0
419260,421260,"You guys are laughing,",HA7GwKXfJB0
421260,423260,"but you know, this book changed my life.",HA7GwKXfJB0
423260,425260,(Laughter),HA7GwKXfJB0
427260,430260,"But seriously, what's wrong with this?",HA7GwKXfJB0
430260,433260,You already know enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement?,HA7GwKXfJB0
440260,443260,"It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl,",HA7GwKXfJB0
443260,446260,everyone's brains are like spaghetti.,HA7GwKXfJB0
446260,449260,"Or maybe really, really fine capellini with branches.",HA7GwKXfJB0
450260,452260,Just as one strand of spaghetti,HA7GwKXfJB0
452260,455260,"contacts many other strands on your plate,",HA7GwKXfJB0
455260,457260,one neuron touches many other neurons,HA7GwKXfJB0
457260,459260,through their entangled branches.,HA7GwKXfJB0
459260,462260,"One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons,",HA7GwKXfJB0
462260,464260,because there can be synapses,HA7GwKXfJB0
464260,467260,at these points of contact.,HA7GwKXfJB0
469260,472260,"By now, you might have sort of lost perspective",HA7GwKXfJB0
472260,475260,on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is.,HA7GwKXfJB0
475260,478260,And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you.,HA7GwKXfJB0
478260,481260,"I assure you, this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side.",HA7GwKXfJB0
483260,486260,"So, here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron.",HA7GwKXfJB0
486260,489260,"And you can tell that, really, only the smallest fragments of branches",HA7GwKXfJB0
489260,492260,are contained inside this cube.,HA7GwKXfJB0
492260,495260,"And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.",HA7GwKXfJB0
497260,499260,And that's just a mouse brain --,HA7GwKXfJB0
501260,504260,it's a lot smaller than a human brain.,HA7GwKXfJB0
505260,507260,"So when show my friends this,",HA7GwKXfJB0

554260,556260,"I feel curiosity,",HA7GwKXfJB0
556260,558260,"and I feel wonder,",HA7GwKXfJB0
558260,561260,but at times I have also felt despair.,HA7GwKXfJB0
562260,564260,Why did I choose to study,HA7GwKXfJB0
564260,567260,this organ that is so awesome in its complexity,HA7GwKXfJB0
567260,569260,that it might well be infinite?,HA7GwKXfJB0
569260,571260,It's absurd.,HA7GwKXfJB0
571260,573260,How could we even dare to think,HA7GwKXfJB0
573260,576260,that we might ever understand this?,HA7GwKXfJB0
578260,581260,"And yet, I persist in this quixotic endeavor.",HA7GwKXfJB0
581260,584260,"And indeed, these days I harbor new hopes.",HA7GwKXfJB0
585260,587260,"Someday,",HA7GwKXfJB0
587260,589260,a fleet of microscopes will capture,HA7GwKXfJB0
589260,591260,every neuron and every synapse,HA7GwKXfJB0
591260,594260,in a vast database of images.,HA7GwKXfJB0
594260,597260,"And some day, artificially intelligent supercomputers",HA7GwKXfJB0
597260,600260,will analyze the images without human assistance,HA7GwKXfJB0
600260,603260,to summarize them in a connectome.,HA7GwKXfJB0
604260,607260,"I do not know, but I hope that I will live to see that day,",HA7GwKXfJB0
608260,610260,because finding an entire human connectome,HA7GwKXfJB0
610260,613260,is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time.,HA7GwKXfJB0
613260,616260,It will take the work of generations to succeed.,HA7GwKXfJB0
617260,620260,"At the present time, my collaborators and I,",HA7GwKXfJB0
620260,622260,what we're aiming for is much more modest --,HA7GwKXfJB0
622260,624260,just to find partial connectomes,HA7GwKXfJB0
624260,627260,of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain.,HA7GwKXfJB0
627260,630260,But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis,HA7GwKXfJB0
630260,633260,that I am my connectome.,HA7GwKXfJB0
635260,638260,"For now, let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis,",HA7GwKXfJB0
638260,641260,that it's actually worth taking seriously.,HA7GwKXfJB0
642260,644260,As you grow during childhood,HA7GwKXfJB0
644260,647260,"and age during adulthood,",HA7GwKXfJB0
647260,650260,your personal identity changes slowly.,HA7GwKXfJB0
650260,652260,"Likewise, every connectome",HA7GwKXfJB0
652260,654260,changes over time.,HA7GwKXfJB0
655260,657260,What kinds of changes happen?,HA7GwKXfJB0
657260,659260,"Well, neurons, like trees,",HA7GwKXfJB0
659260,661260,"can grow new branches,",HA7GwKXfJB0
661260,664260,and they can lose old ones.,HA7GwKXfJB0
664260,667260,"Synapses can be created,",HA7GwKXfJB0
667260,670260,and they can be eliminated.,HA7GwKXfJB0
670260,672260,"And synapses can grow larger,",HA7GwKXfJB0
672260,675260,and they can grow smaller.,HA7GwKXfJB0
675260,677260,Second question:,HA7GwKXfJB0
677260,680260,what causes these changes?,HA7GwKXfJB0
680260,682260,"Well, it's true.",HA7GwKXfJB0
682260,685260,"To some extent, they are programmed by your genes.",HA7GwKXfJB0
685260,687260,"But that's not the whole story,",HA7GwKXfJB0
687260,689260,"because there are signals, electrical signals,",HA7GwKXfJB0
689260,691260,that travel along the branches of neurons,HA7GwKXfJB0
691260,693260,and chemical signals,HA7GwKXfJB0
693260,695260,that jump across from branch to branch.,HA7GwKXfJB0
695260,698260,These signals are called neural activity.,HA7GwKXfJB0
698260,700260,And there's a lot of evidence,HA7GwKXfJB0
700260,703260,that neural activity,HA7GwKXfJB0
703260,706260,"is encoding our thoughts, feelings and perceptions,",HA7GwKXfJB0
706260,708260,our mental experiences.,HA7GwKXfJB0
708260,711260,And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity,HA7GwKXfJB0
711260,714260,can cause your connections to change.,HA7GwKXfJB0
714260,717260,"And if you put those two facts together,",HA7GwKXfJB0
717260,719260,it means that your experiences,HA7GwKXfJB0
719260,722260,can change your connectome.,HA7GwKXfJB0
722260,724260,"And that's why every connectome is unique,",HA7GwKXfJB0
724260,727260,even those of genetically identical twins.,HA7GwKXfJB0
728260,731260,The connectome is where nature meets nurture.,HA7GwKXfJB0
732260,734260,And it might true,HA7GwKXfJB0
734260,736260,that just the mere act of thinking,HA7GwKXfJB0
736260,738260,can change your connectome --,HA7GwKXfJB0
738260,741260,an idea that you may find empowering.,HA7GwKXfJB0
744260,746260,What's in this picture?,HA7GwKXfJB0
748260,751260,"A cool and refreshing stream of water, you say.",HA7GwKXfJB0
752260,754260,What else is in this picture?,HA7GwKXfJB0
757260,759260,Do not forget that groove in the Earth,HA7GwKXfJB0
759260,762260,called the stream bed.,HA7GwKXfJB0
762260,765260,"Without it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.",HA7GwKXfJB0
765260,767260,"And with the stream,",HA7GwKXfJB0
767260,769260,I would like to propose a metaphor,HA7GwKXfJB0
769260,771260,for the relationship between neural activity,HA7GwKXfJB0
771260,773260,and connectivity.,HA7GwKXfJB0
774260,777260,Neural activity is constantly changing.,HA7GwKXfJB0
777260,780260,It's like the water of the stream; it never sits still.,HA7GwKXfJB0
780260,782260,The connections,HA7GwKXfJB0
782260,784260,of the brain's neural network,HA7GwKXfJB0
784260,786260,determines the pathways,HA7GwKXfJB0
786260,788260,along which neural activity flows.,HA7GwKXfJB0
788260,791260,And so the connectome is like bed of the stream;,HA7GwKXfJB0
793260,796260,"but the metaphor is richer than that,",HA7GwKXfJB0
796260,799260,because it's true that the stream bed,HA7GwKXfJB0
799260,801260,"guides the flow of the water,",HA7GwKXfJB0
801260,803260,"but over long timescales,",HA7GwKXfJB0
803260,806260,the water also reshapes the bed of the stream.,HA7GwKXfJB0
806260,808260,"And as I told you just now,",HA7GwKXfJB0
808260,811260,neural activity can change the connectome.,HA7GwKXfJB0
813260,815260,And if you'll allow me to ascend,HA7GwKXfJB0
815260,818260,"to metaphorical heights,",HA7GwKXfJB0
818260,821260,I will remind you that neural activity,HA7GwKXfJB0
821260,823260,is the physical basis -- or so neuroscientists think --,HA7GwKXfJB0
823260,826260,"of thoughts, feelings and perceptions.",HA7GwKXfJB0
826260,828260,And so we might even speak of,HA7GwKXfJB0
828260,830260,the stream of consciousness.,HA7GwKXfJB0
830260,833260,"Neural activity is its water,",HA7GwKXfJB0
833260,836260,and the connectome is its bed.,HA7GwKXfJB0
837260,839260,So let's return from the heights of metaphor,HA7GwKXfJB0
839260,841260,and return to science.,HA7GwKXfJB0
841260,843260,Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes,HA7GwKXfJB0
843260,845260,actually work.,HA7GwKXfJB0
845260,847260,How will we go about testing the hypothesis,HA7GwKXfJB0
847260,850260,"I am my connectome?""""",HA7GwKXfJB0
850260,853260,"Well, I propose a direct test.",HA7GwKXfJB0
853260,855260,Let us attempt,HA7GwKXfJB0
855260,858260,to read out memories from connectomes.,HA7GwKXfJB0
858260,860260,Consider the memory,HA7GwKXfJB0
860260,863260,"of long temporal sequences of movements,",HA7GwKXfJB0
863260,866260,like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata.,HA7GwKXfJB0
866260,869260,"According to a theory that dates back to the 19th century,",HA7GwKXfJB0
869260,871260,such memories are stored,HA7GwKXfJB0
871260,874260,as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain.,HA7GwKXfJB0
875260,878260,"Because, if the first neurons in the chain are activated,",HA7GwKXfJB0
878260,881260,"through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons, which are activated,",HA7GwKXfJB0
881260,883260,"and so on down the line,",HA7GwKXfJB0
883260,885260,like a chain of falling dominoes.,HA7GwKXfJB0
885260,887260,And this sequence of neural activation,HA7GwKXfJB0
887260,890260,is hypothesized to be the neural basis,HA7GwKXfJB0
890260,892260,of those sequence of movements.,HA7GwKXfJB0
892260,894260,So one way of trying to test the theory,HA7GwKXfJB0
894260,896260,is to look for such chains,HA7GwKXfJB0
896260,898260,inside connectomes.,HA7GwKXfJB0
898260,901260,"But it won't be easy, because they're not going to look like this.",HA7GwKXfJB0
901260,903260,They're going to be scrambled up.,HA7GwKXfJB0
903260,905260,So we'll have to use our computers,HA7GwKXfJB0
905260,908260,to try to unscramble the chain.,HA7GwKXfJB0
908260,910260,"And if we can do that,",HA7GwKXfJB0
910260,913260,the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling,HA7GwKXfJB0
913260,916260,will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity,HA7GwKXfJB0
916260,919260,that is replayed in the brain during memory recall.,HA7GwKXfJB0
919260,921260,"And if that were successful,",HA7GwKXfJB0
921260,924260,that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome.,HA7GwKXfJB0
928260,930260,(Laughter),HA7GwKXfJB0
930260,932260,What a mess --,HA7GwKXfJB0
933260,935260,have you ever tried to wire up a system,HA7GwKXfJB0
935260,937260,as complex as this?,HA7GwKXfJB0
937260,939260,I hope not.,HA7GwKXfJB0
939260,942260,"But if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake.",HA7GwKXfJB0
945260,947260,The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain.,HA7GwKXfJB0
947260,951260,Can anyone guess: what's the total length of wires in your brain?,HA7GwKXfJB0
954260,956260,I'll give you a hint. It's a big number.,HA7GwKXfJB0
956260,958260,(Laughter),HA7GwKXfJB0
959260,962260,"I estimate, millions of miles,",HA7GwKXfJB0
962260,965260,all packed in your skull.,HA7GwKXfJB0
965260,967260,"And if you appreciate that number,",HA7GwKXfJB0
967260,969260,you can easily see,HA7GwKXfJB0
969260,971260,there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain.,HA7GwKXfJB0
971260,974260,"And indeed, the popular press loves headlines like,",HA7GwKXfJB0
974260,976260,"Anorexic brains are wired differently,""""",HA7GwKXfJB0
976260,978260,"or Autistic brains are wired differently.""""",HA7GwKXfJB0
978260,980260,"These are plausible claims,",HA7GwKXfJB0
980260,982260,"but in truth,",HA7GwKXfJB0
982260,984260,we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough,HA7GwKXfJB0
984260,986260,to tell if these are really true.,HA7GwKXfJB0
986260,989260,And so the technologies for seeing connectomes,HA7GwKXfJB0
989260,991260,will allow us to finally,HA7GwKXfJB0
991260,993260,"read mis-wiring of the brain,",HA7GwKXfJB0
993260,996260,to see mental disorders in connectomes.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1000260,1003260,Sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis,HA7GwKXfJB0
1003260,1006260,is to consider its most extreme implication.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1006260,1009260,Philosophers know this game very well.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1010260,1013260,"If you believe that I am my connectome,",HA7GwKXfJB0
1013260,1016260,I think you must also accept the idea,HA7GwKXfJB0
1016260,1018260,that death is the destruction,HA7GwKXfJB0
1018260,1021260,of your connectome.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1022260,1025260,I mention this because there are prophets today,HA7GwKXfJB0
1025260,1028260,who claim that technology,HA7GwKXfJB0
1028260,1031260,will fundamentally alter the human condition,HA7GwKXfJB0
1031260,1034260,and perhaps even transform the human species.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1034260,1037260,One of their most cherished dreams,HA7GwKXfJB0
1037260,1039260,is to cheat death,HA7GwKXfJB0
1039260,1041260,by that practice known as cryonics.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1041260,1043260,"If you pay 100,000 dollars,",HA7GwKXfJB0
1043260,1046260,you can arrange to have your body frozen after death,HA7GwKXfJB0
1046260,1048260,and stored in liquid nitrogen,HA7GwKXfJB0
1048260,1050260,"in one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse,",HA7GwKXfJB0
1050260,1052260,awaiting a future civilization,HA7GwKXfJB0
1052260,1055260,that is advanced to resurrect you.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1056260,1058260,"Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality,",HA7GwKXfJB0
1058260,1060260,calling them fools?,HA7GwKXfJB0
1060260,1062260,Or will they someday chuckle,HA7GwKXfJB0
1062260,1064260,over our graves?,HA7GwKXfJB0
1065260,1067260,I don't know --,HA7GwKXfJB0
1067260,1070260,"I prefer to test their beliefs, scientifically.",HA7GwKXfJB0
1070260,1072260,I propose that we attempt to find a connectome,HA7GwKXfJB0
1072260,1074260,of a frozen brain.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1074260,1076260,We know that damage to the brain,HA7GwKXfJB0
1076260,1078260,occurs after death and during freezing.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1078260,1081260,The question is: has that damage erased the connectome?,HA7GwKXfJB0
1081260,1084260,"If it has, there is no way that any future civilization",HA7GwKXfJB0
1084260,1087260,will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1087260,1089260,"Resurrection might succeed for the body,",HA7GwKXfJB0
1089260,1091260,but not for the mind.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1091260,1094260,"On the other hand, if the connectome is still intact,",HA7GwKXfJB0
1094260,1097260,we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1100260,1102260,I've described a quest,HA7GwKXfJB0
1102260,1105260,"that begins in the world of the very small,",HA7GwKXfJB0
1105260,1108260,and propels us to the world of the far future.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1108260,1111260,Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1112260,1114260,As we evolved from our ape-like ancestors,HA7GwKXfJB0
1114260,1116260,"on the African savanna,",HA7GwKXfJB0
1116260,1119260,what distinguished us was our larger brains.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1120260,1122260,We have used our brains to fashion,HA7GwKXfJB0
1122260,1125260,ever more amazing technologies.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1125260,1128260,"Eventually, these technologies will become so powerful",HA7GwKXfJB0
1128260,1131260,that we will use them to know ourselves,HA7GwKXfJB0
1131260,1134260,by deconstructing and reconstructing,HA7GwKXfJB0
1134260,1137260,our own brains.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1137260,1140260,I believe that this voyage of self-discovery,HA7GwKXfJB0
1140260,1143260,"is not just for scientists,",HA7GwKXfJB0
1143260,1145260,but for all of us.,HA7GwKXfJB0
1145260,1148260,And I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today.,HA7GwKXfJB0

13478.0,15351.0,Francesca Fedeli: Ciao.,GhpFTQfiqCs
15375.0,18907.0,So he's Mario. He's our son.,GhpFTQfiqCs
18931.0,21766.0,"He was born two and a half years ago,",GhpFTQfiqCs
21790.0,24979.0,and I had a pretty tough pregnancy,GhpFTQfiqCs
25003.0,29129.0,"because I had to stay still
in a bed for, like, eight months.",GhpFTQfiqCs
29153.0,32188.0,"But in the end everything
seemed to be under control.",GhpFTQfiqCs
32212.0,35042.0,So he got the right weight at birth.,GhpFTQfiqCs
35066.0,37189.0,He got the right Apgar index.,GhpFTQfiqCs
37213.0,40274.0,So we were pretty reassured by this.,GhpFTQfiqCs
40298.0,47126.0,"But at the end, 10 days
later after he was born,",GhpFTQfiqCs
47150.0,49673.0,we discovered that he had a stroke.,GhpFTQfiqCs
49697.0,51543.0,"As you might know,",GhpFTQfiqCs
51567.0,54109.0,a stroke is a brain injury.,GhpFTQfiqCs
54133.0,56819.0,A perinatal stroke could be something,GhpFTQfiqCs
56843.0,60734.0,"that can happen
during the nine months of pregnancy",GhpFTQfiqCs
60758.0,63326.0,"or just suddenly after the birth,",GhpFTQfiqCs
63350.0,66223.0,"and in his case, as you can see,",GhpFTQfiqCs
66247.0,70415.0,the right part of his brain has gone.,GhpFTQfiqCs
70439.0,75906.0,"So the effect that this stroke
could have on Mario's body",GhpFTQfiqCs
75930.0,79150.0,"could be the fact that he couldn't
be able to control",GhpFTQfiqCs
79174.0,81926.0,the left side of his body.,GhpFTQfiqCs
81950.0,85751.0,"Just imagine, if you have
a computer and a printer",GhpFTQfiqCs
85775.0,89940.0,"and you want to transmit,
to input to print out a document,",GhpFTQfiqCs
89964.0,93384.0,"but the printer doesn't
have the right drives,",GhpFTQfiqCs
93408.0,96168.0,so the same is for Mario.,GhpFTQfiqCs
96192.0,99188.0,"It's just like,
he would like to move his left side",GhpFTQfiqCs

with such kinds of disabilities,",GhpFTQfiqCs
129291.0,131354.0,and as many questions as possible started,GhpFTQfiqCs

160540.0,163304.0,"but a few months later, we realized that",GhpFTQfiqCs
163328.0,166564.0,we were really feeling like a failure.,GhpFTQfiqCs
166588.0,169585.0,"I mean, the only real product of our life,",GhpFTQfiqCs
169609.0,171425.0,"at the end, was a failure.",GhpFTQfiqCs

for ourselves in itself,",GhpFTQfiqCs

182113.0,183863.0,"Honestly, we went down.",GhpFTQfiqCs
183887.0,187398.0,"I mean we went really
down, but at the end,",GhpFTQfiqCs
187422.0,189292.0,"we started to look at him,",GhpFTQfiqCs
189316.0,191541.0,"and we said, we have to react.",GhpFTQfiqCs
191565.0,194419.0,"So immediately, as Francesca
said, we changed our life.",GhpFTQfiqCs
194443.0,197876.0,"We started physiotherapy,
we started the rehabilitation,",GhpFTQfiqCs
197900.0,199948.0,"and one of the paths
that we were following",GhpFTQfiqCs
199972.0,202953.0,"in terms of rehabilitation
is the mirror neurons pilot.",GhpFTQfiqCs
202977.0,206744.0,"Basically, we spent months
doing this with Mario.",GhpFTQfiqCs
206768.0,209589.0,"You have an object, and we showed him",GhpFTQfiqCs
209613.0,211610.0,how to grab the object.,GhpFTQfiqCs
211634.0,214194.0,"Now, the theory of mirror
neurons simply says",GhpFTQfiqCs
214218.0,218366.0,"that in your brains, exactly
now, as you watch me doing this,",GhpFTQfiqCs
218390.0,220876.0,"you are activating
exactly the same neurons",GhpFTQfiqCs
220900.0,224113.0,as if you do the actions.,GhpFTQfiqCs
224137.0,228109.0,"It looks like this is the leading
edge in terms of rehabilitation.",GhpFTQfiqCs
228133.0,231961.0,But one day we found that Mario,GhpFTQfiqCs
231985.0,235336.0,was not looking at our hand.,GhpFTQfiqCs
235360.0,237910.0,He was looking at us.,GhpFTQfiqCs
237934.0,240105.0,We were his mirror.,GhpFTQfiqCs
240129.0,242153.0,"And the problem, as you might feel,",GhpFTQfiqCs
242177.0,244598.0,"is that we were down, we were depressed,",GhpFTQfiqCs
244622.0,246970.0,"we were looking at him as a problem,",GhpFTQfiqCs
246994.0,251475.0,"not as a son, not
from a positive perspective.",GhpFTQfiqCs
251499.0,254715.0,"And that day really
changed our perspective.",GhpFTQfiqCs
254739.0,258035.0,We realized that we had to become,GhpFTQfiqCs

260626.0,262690.0,"We restarted from our strengths,",GhpFTQfiqCs

we restarted from his strengths.",GhpFTQfiqCs
266417.0,269091.0,"We stopped looking at him as a problem,",GhpFTQfiqCs
269115.0,273491.0,"and we started to look at him
as an opportunity to improve.",GhpFTQfiqCs
273515.0,276049.0,"And really, this was the change,",GhpFTQfiqCs
276073.0,279208.0,"and from our side, we said,",GhpFTQfiqCs
279232.0,282355.0,What are our strengths,GhpFTQfiqCs
,,,GhpFTQfiqCs
282379.0,283951.0,And we started from our passions.,GhpFTQfiqCs

285809.0,287009.0,"are quite different,",GhpFTQfiqCs

things that we can show to him.",GhpFTQfiqCs
299967.0,305144.0,This short video is from last week.,GhpFTQfiqCs

33260,36260,What has changed our society,pTZM9X3JfTk
36260,38260,has been wireless devices.,pTZM9X3JfTk
38260,43260,"But the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK?",pTZM9X3JfTk
43260,45260,"So, let me give you some examples of this",pTZM9X3JfTk
45260,48260,to kind of make this much more concrete.,pTZM9X3JfTk
48260,51260,This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram.,pTZM9X3JfTk
51260,54260,"And, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time",pTZM9X3JfTk
54260,57260,"a patient, an individual, anywhere in the world",pTZM9X3JfTk
57260,59260,"on your smartphone,",pTZM9X3JfTk
59260,61260,"watching your rhythm -- that's incredible,",pTZM9X3JfTk
61260,63260,and it's with us today.,pTZM9X3JfTk
63260,66260,But that's just the beginning.,pTZM9X3JfTk
66260,69260,You check your email while you're sitting here.,pTZM9X3JfTk
69260,73260,"In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs,",pTZM9X3JfTk
73260,75260,"all your vital signs: your heart rhythm,",pTZM9X3JfTk
75260,79260,"your blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.",pTZM9X3JfTk
79260,81260,This is already available today.,pTZM9X3JfTk
81260,83260,This is AirStrip Technologies.,pTZM9X3JfTk
83260,87260,"It's now wired -- or I should say, wireless --",pTZM9X3JfTk
87260,89260,by taking the aggregate of these signals,pTZM9X3JfTk
89260,91260,"in the hospital, in the intensive care unit,",pTZM9X3JfTk
91260,94260,and putting it on a smartphone for physicians.,pTZM9X3JfTk
94260,96260,"If you're an expectant parent,",pTZM9X3JfTk
96260,99260,"what about the ability to monitor, continuously,",pTZM9X3JfTk
99260,102260,"fetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions,",pTZM9X3JfTk
102260,105260,and not having to worry so much that things are,pTZM9X3JfTk
105260,107260,"fine as the pregnancy,",pTZM9X3JfTk
107260,110260,and moving over into the time of delivery?,pTZM9X3JfTk
110260,113260,"And then as we go further,",pTZM9X3JfTk
113260,115260,today we have continuous glucose sensors.,pTZM9X3JfTk
115260,117260,"Right now, they are under the skin,",pTZM9X3JfTk
117260,121260,"but in the future, they won't have to be implanted.",pTZM9X3JfTk
121260,123260,"And of course, the desired range -- trying to keep glucose",pTZM9X3JfTk
123260,127260,"between 75 and less than 200,",pTZM9X3JfTk
127260,130260,checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor --,pTZM9X3JfTk
130260,132260,you'll see how that can impact diabetes.,pTZM9X3JfTk
132260,134260,And what about sleep?,pTZM9X3JfTk
134260,136260,We're going to zoom in on that a little bit.,pTZM9X3JfTk
136260,138260,We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep.,pTZM9X3JfTk
138260,140260,"What if, on your phone,",pTZM9X3JfTk
140260,142260,"which will be available in the next few weeks,",pTZM9X3JfTk
142260,145260,you had every minute of your sleep displayed?,pTZM9X3JfTk
145260,148260,"And this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange.",pTZM9X3JfTk
148260,150260,"The REM sleep, rapid eye movement,",pTZM9X3JfTk
150260,152260,"dream state, is in light green;",pTZM9X3JfTk
152260,154260,"and light is gray, light sleep;",pTZM9X3JfTk
154260,156260,"and deep sleep, the best restorative sleep,",pTZM9X3JfTk
156260,158260,is that dark green.,pTZM9X3JfTk
158260,160260,How about counting every calorie?,pTZM9X3JfTk
160260,163260,"And this is ability, in real time, to actually take",pTZM9X3JfTk
163260,165260,measurements of caloric intake,pTZM9X3JfTk
165260,168260,"as well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid.",pTZM9X3JfTk
168260,171260,"Now, what I've talked about are physiologic metrics.",pTZM9X3JfTk
171260,174260,"But what I want to get to, the next frontier,",pTZM9X3JfTk
174260,176260,"very quickly, and why the stethoscope",pTZM9X3JfTk
176260,178260,"is on its way out,",pTZM9X3JfTk
178260,182260,"is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds,",pTZM9X3JfTk
182260,184260,"and the breath sounds, because now,",pTZM9X3JfTk
184260,187260,introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound.,pTZM9X3JfTk
187260,190260,Why is this important? Because this is so much more sensitive.,pTZM9X3JfTk
190260,193260,"Here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound,",pTZM9X3JfTk
193260,197260,"and also a cardiac echo, which can be sent wireless,",pTZM9X3JfTk
197260,201260,and then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone.,pTZM9X3JfTk
201260,204260,"So, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics --",pTZM9X3JfTk
204260,207260,"the key measurements of vital signs,",pTZM9X3JfTk
207260,210260,and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging,pTZM9X3JfTk
210260,212260,that one could look at in your smartphone.,pTZM9X3JfTk
212260,216260,"Now, this is an example of another obsolete technology,",pTZM9X3JfTk
216260,218260,soon to be buried: the Holter Monitor.,pTZM9X3JfTk
218260,220260,"Twenty-four hour recording, lots of wires.",pTZM9X3JfTk
220260,222260,This is now a little tiny patch.,pTZM9X3JfTk
222260,224260,You can put it on for two weeks,pTZM9X3JfTk
224260,227260,and send it in the mail.,pTZM9X3JfTk
227260,229260,"Now, how does this work? Well,",pTZM9X3JfTk
229260,231260,there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors,pTZM9X3JfTk
231260,234260,"that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.",pTZM9X3JfTk
234260,237260,And this sends a signal,pTZM9X3JfTk
237260,241260,and it creates a body area network to a gateway.,pTZM9X3JfTk
241260,244260,"Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway,",pTZM9X3JfTk
244260,246260,"as today many of these things are dedicated gateways,",pTZM9X3JfTk
246260,248260,because they are not so well integrated.,pTZM9X3JfTk
248260,251260,"That signal goes to the web, the cloud,",pTZM9X3JfTk
251260,253260,and then it can be processed and sent anywhere:,pTZM9X3JfTk
253260,255260,"to a caregiver, to a physician,",pTZM9X3JfTk
255260,257260,"back to the patient, etc.",pTZM9X3JfTk
257260,260260,"So, that's basically very simplistic technology",pTZM9X3JfTk
260260,262260,of how this works.,pTZM9X3JfTk
262260,264260,"Now, I have this device on.",pTZM9X3JfTk
264260,267260,"I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.",pTZM9X3JfTk
267260,271260,"This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm,",pTZM9X3JfTk
271260,273260,"as you saw already,",pTZM9X3JfTk
273260,276260,but it also goes well beyond that.,pTZM9X3JfTk
276260,279260,This is me now. And you can see the ECG.,pTZM9X3JfTk
279260,282260,Below that's the actual heart rate and the trend;,pTZM9X3JfTk
282260,284260,to the right of that is a bioconductant.,pTZM9X3JfTk
284260,286260,"That's the fluid status,",pTZM9X3JfTk
286260,288260,"fluid status, that's really important",pTZM9X3JfTk
288260,290260,if you're monitoring somebody with heart failure.,pTZM9X3JfTk
290260,292260,"And below that's temperature,",pTZM9X3JfTk
292260,294260,"and respiration, and oxygen,",pTZM9X3JfTk
294260,296260,and then the position activity.,pTZM9X3JfTk
296260,299260,"So, this is really striking, because this device",pTZM9X3JfTk
299260,301260,measures seven things,pTZM9X3JfTk
301260,304260,that are very much vital signs,pTZM9X3JfTk
304260,308260,for monitoring someone with heart failure. OK?,pTZM9X3JfTk
308260,310260,"And why is this important? Well,",pTZM9X3JfTk
310260,313260,this is the most expensive bed.,pTZM9X3JfTk
313260,316260,What if we could reduce the need for hospital beds?,pTZM9X3JfTk
316260,318260,"Well, we can. First of all, heart failure",pTZM9X3JfTk
318260,321260,is the number one reason,pTZM9X3JfTk
321260,324260,for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country.,pTZM9X3JfTk
324260,329260,"The cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year,",pTZM9X3JfTk
329260,332260,which is 80 percent related to hospitalization.,pTZM9X3JfTk
332260,335260,And in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay,pTZM9X3JfTk
335260,338260,"for a Medicare greater than 65 years or older,",pTZM9X3JfTk
338260,341260,"is -- 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days,",pTZM9X3JfTk
341260,345260,"and by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted.",pTZM9X3JfTk
345260,347260,"So, can we improve that? Well the idea is",pTZM9X3JfTk
347260,349260,"we take this device that I'm wearing,",pTZM9X3JfTk
349260,353260,"and we put it on 600 patients with heart failure,",pTZM9X3JfTk
353260,355260,"randomly assigned, versus 600 patients",pTZM9X3JfTk
355260,357260,"who don't have active monitoring,",pTZM9X3JfTk
357260,360260,"and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions,",pTZM9X3JfTk
360260,362260,"and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial,",pTZM9X3JfTk
362260,364260,"and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that,",pTZM9X3JfTk
364260,367260,but that's a type of wireless device trial,pTZM9X3JfTk
367260,370260,that could change medicine in the years ahead.,pTZM9X3JfTk
370260,373260,Why now? Why has this all of a sudden become,pTZM9X3JfTk
373260,377260,"a reality, an exciting direction in the future of medicine?",pTZM9X3JfTk
377260,381260,"What we have is, in a way, a perfect positive storm.",pTZM9X3JfTk
381260,383260,This sets up consumer-driven healthcare.,pTZM9X3JfTk
383260,385260,That's where this is all starting.,pTZM9X3JfTk

399260,401260,And this Wired Magazine cover article,pTZM9X3JfTk
401260,404260,really captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe,pTZM9X3JfTk

1009260,1012260,Thanks for your attention.,pTZM9X3JfTk
1012260,1014260,(Applause),pTZM9X3JfTk
16160,18160,"What I'd like you to do is, just really quickly,",3GXlvP4kLHg
18160,21160,"is just, sort of, nod to the person on your right,",3GXlvP4kLHg
21160,24160,and then nod to the person on your left.,3GXlvP4kLHg
24160,28160,(Laughter),3GXlvP4kLHg
28160,32160,"Now, chances are that over the last winter,",3GXlvP4kLHg
32160,35160,"if you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people",3GXlvP4kLHg
35160,39160,you just nodded at would have died.,3GXlvP4kLHg
39160,43160,"Now, that's an awful lot of bees.",3GXlvP4kLHg
43160,47160,And this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent,3GXlvP4kLHg
47160,51160,"of the colonies, or we estimate we've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter.",3GXlvP4kLHg
51160,57160,"Now, that's a lot, a lot of bees, and that's really important.",3GXlvP4kLHg
57160,60160,And most of those losses are because of things we know.,3GXlvP4kLHg
60160,63160,We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced,3GXlvP4kLHg
63160,66160,"and caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon,",3GXlvP4kLHg
66160,69160,"which I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder.",3GXlvP4kLHg
69160,74160,And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December.,3GXlvP4kLHg
74160,76160,"And below, you can see all these out yards,",3GXlvP4kLHg
76160,81160,"or temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February,",3GXlvP4kLHg
81160,84160,and then they're shipped out to the almonds.,3GXlvP4kLHg
84160,87160,"And one documentary writer, who was here and looked at this two months",3GXlvP4kLHg
87160,90160,"after I was here, described this not as beehives",3GXlvP4kLHg
90160,96160,"but as a graveyard, with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them.",3GXlvP4kLHg
96160,100160,"Now, I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences",3GXlvP4kLHg
100160,102160,to say that we have been trying to figure out,3GXlvP4kLHg
102160,104160,what the cause of this is.,3GXlvP4kLHg
104160,107160,And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.,3GXlvP4kLHg
107160,112160,And this flu has wiped through the population of bees.,3GXlvP4kLHg
112160,116160,"In some cases, and in fact in most cases in one year,",3GXlvP4kLHg
116160,119160,"this flu was caused by a new virus to us,",3GXlvP4kLHg
119160,123160,"or newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.",3GXlvP4kLHg
123160,125160,"It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it,",3GXlvP4kLHg
125160,129160,"and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease, because,",3GXlvP4kLHg
129160,130160,"of course, there's the implication.",3GXlvP4kLHg
130160,133160,But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.,3GXlvP4kLHg
133160,136160,It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses,3GXlvP4kLHg
136160,140160,"or other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with,",3GXlvP4kLHg
140160,142160,"and the question that keeps us up at night,",3GXlvP4kLHg
142160,147160,"is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu,",3GXlvP4kLHg
147160,152160,and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases?,3GXlvP4kLHg
152160,154160,"And we don't have the answer to that yet,",3GXlvP4kLHg
154160,157160,and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.,3GXlvP4kLHg
157160,159160,We think perhaps it's a combination of factors.,3GXlvP4kLHg
159160,163160,We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team,3GXlvP4kLHg
163160,167160,"that, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides",3GXlvP4kLHg
167160,170160,"in the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives",3GXlvP4kLHg
170160,173160,have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these,3GXlvP4kLHg
173160,177160,very strange things that we can't begin to understand.,3GXlvP4kLHg
177160,182160,And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health.,3GXlvP4kLHg
182160,185160,"Now of course, if you lose a lot of colonies,",3GXlvP4kLHg
185160,187160,beekeepers can replace them very quickly.,3GXlvP4kLHg
187160,190160,And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.,3GXlvP4kLHg
190160,194160,"If we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know,",3GXlvP4kLHg
194160,195160,the National Guard would be out.,3GXlvP4kLHg
195160,199160,"But what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony,",3GXlvP4kLHg
199160,202160,they can split that colony in two.,3GXlvP4kLHg
202160,205160,"And then the one half that doesn't have a queen, they can buy a queen.",3GXlvP4kLHg
205160,209160,"It comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida,",3GXlvP4kLHg
209160,211160,and you can introduce that queen.,3GXlvP4kLHg
211160,213160,"And in fact, America was the first country",3GXlvP4kLHg
213160,216160,"that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact,",3GXlvP4kLHg
216160,223160,it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail,3GXlvP4kLHg
223160,228160,in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country.,3GXlvP4kLHg
228160,230160,"If you don't just want a queen, you can buy, actually,",3GXlvP4kLHg
230160,234160,"a three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course,",3GXlvP4kLHg
234160,237160,"the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get,",3GXlvP4kLHg
237160,239160,"you know, your three-pound packages of bees.",3GXlvP4kLHg
239160,243160,And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.,3GXlvP4kLHg
243160,247160,"So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs,",3GXlvP4kLHg
247160,250160,and so they've been able to cover those losses.,3GXlvP4kLHg
250160,253160,"So even though we've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year,",3GXlvP4kLHg
253160,257160,"the same number of colonies have existed in the country,",3GXlvP4kLHg
257160,260160,at about 2.4 million colonies.,3GXlvP4kLHg
260160,264160,"Now, those losses are tragic on many fronts,",3GXlvP4kLHg
264160,266160,and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.,3GXlvP4kLHg
266160,269160,"And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first,",3GXlvP4kLHg
269160,272160,because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet.,3GXlvP4kLHg
272160,275160,"If this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone",3GXlvP4kLHg
275160,280160,"from the card-carrying NRA member who's, you know, live free or die,",3GXlvP4kLHg
280160,283160,"to the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco",3GXlvP4kLHg
283160,285160,backyard pig farmer.,3GXlvP4kLHg
285160,287160,(Laughter),3GXlvP4kLHg
287160,290160,"And you get all of these people in the same room,",3GXlvP4kLHg
290160,294160,"and they're all engaged and they're getting along,",3GXlvP4kLHg
294160,297160,and they're all there because of the passion for bees.,3GXlvP4kLHg
297160,299160,"Now, there's another part of that community",3GXlvP4kLHg
299160,300160,"which are the commercial beekeepers,",3GXlvP4kLHg
300160,303160,the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone.,3GXlvP4kLHg
303160,311160,"And these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious,",3GXlvP4kLHg
311160,315160,"intuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet.",3GXlvP4kLHg
315160,318160,They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.,3GXlvP4kLHg
318160,322160,I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year.,3GXlvP4kLHg
322160,325160,"And Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy.",3GXlvP4kLHg
325160,327160,"I mean, there may be 100 explanations",3GXlvP4kLHg
327160,330160,"for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is,",3GXlvP4kLHg
330160,333160,but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.,3GXlvP4kLHg
333160,336160,"But you meet this beekeeper, and I met this beekeeper here,",3GXlvP4kLHg
336160,338160,and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met.,3GXlvP4kLHg
338160,340160,"No formal education, but very knowledgeable.",3GXlvP4kLHg
340160,345160,"We needed beeswax for a project we were working on; he was so capable,",3GXlvP4kLHg
345160,349160,he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen,3GXlvP4kLHg
349160,354160,"from cow dung, tin cans and his veil, which he used as a screening,",3GXlvP4kLHg
354160,358160,right in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring.,3GXlvP4kLHg
358160,361160,"We also have Dave Hackenberg, who is the poster child of CCD.",3GXlvP4kLHg
361160,363160,He's the one who first identified this condition,3GXlvP4kLHg
363160,365160,and raised the alarm bells.,3GXlvP4kLHg
365160,367160,"And he has a history of these trucks,",3GXlvP4kLHg
367160,370160,and he's moved these bees up and down the coast.,3GXlvP4kLHg
370160,373160,"And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees,",3GXlvP4kLHg
373160,376160,"and that being bad, but we've done that for thousands of years.",3GXlvP4kLHg
376160,379160,"The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts,",3GXlvP4kLHg
379160,385160,so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.,3GXlvP4kLHg
385160,389160,And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder,3GXlvP4kLHg
389160,393160,is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies.,3GXlvP4kLHg
393160,396160,"And you can do that one year in a row,",3GXlvP4kLHg
396160,398160,you may be able to do it two years in a row.,3GXlvP4kLHg
398160,402160,"But if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies,",3GXlvP4kLHg
402160,405160,you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried,3GXlvP4kLHg
405160,409160,about losing this segment of our industry.,3GXlvP4kLHg
409160,411160,"And that's important for many fronts,",3GXlvP4kLHg
411160,415160,and one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture.,3GXlvP4kLHg
415160,420160,And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America.,3GXlvP4kLHg
420160,421160,"You know, they pick up their hives;",3GXlvP4kLHg
421160,424160,they move their families once or twice in a year.,3GXlvP4kLHg
424160,427160,"And if you look at Florida, in Dade City, Florida,",3GXlvP4kLHg
427160,429160,that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go.,3GXlvP4kLHg
429160,431160,"And then 20 miles down the road is Groveland,",3GXlvP4kLHg
431160,433160,and that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go.,3GXlvP4kLHg
433160,438160,"And if you're ever in Central Valley in February, you go to this café",3GXlvP4kLHg
438160,441160,"at 10 o'clock in the morning, Kathy and Kate's.",3GXlvP4kLHg
441160,444160,And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees,3GXlvP4kLHg
444160,445160,into the almond groves.,3GXlvP4kLHg
445160,446160,They all have their breakfast,3GXlvP4kLHg
446160,451160,"and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience,",3GXlvP4kLHg
451160,454160,"and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time,",3GXlvP4kLHg
454160,457160,because that's quite essential American experience.,3GXlvP4kLHg
457160,461160,"And we see these families, these nomadic families, you know,",3GXlvP4kLHg
461160,465160,"father to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting.",3GXlvP4kLHg
465160,468160,"And they're not people who like to ask for help,",3GXlvP4kLHg
468160,470160,although they are the most helpful people ever.,3GXlvP4kLHg
470160,474160,"If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul,",3GXlvP4kLHg
474160,476160,everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives,3GXlvP4kLHg
476160,478160,to help him replace those lost colonies.,3GXlvP4kLHg
478160,480160,"And so, it's a very dynamic, and I think,",3GXlvP4kLHg
480160,486160,historic and exciting community to be involved with.,3GXlvP4kLHg
487160,490160,"Of course, the real importance for bees is not the honey.",3GXlvP4kLHg
490160,492160,"And although I highly encourage you, all use honey.",3GXlvP4kLHg
492160,495160,"I mean, it's the most ethical sweetener,",3GXlvP4kLHg
495160,498160,"and you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener.",3GXlvP4kLHg
498160,502160,But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat,3GXlvP4kLHg
502160,507160,is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees.,3GXlvP4kLHg
507160,509160,"Now, I want to just illustrate that in the fact",3GXlvP4kLHg
509160,513160,that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning --,3GXlvP4kLHg
513160,516160,"a little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola,",3GXlvP4kLHg
516160,519160,"I should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know,",3GXlvP4kLHg
519160,523160,"jam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee --",3GXlvP4kLHg
523160,528160,"and had we taken out all those ingredients,",3GXlvP4kLHg
528160,530160,-- except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola --,3GXlvP4kLHg
530160,533160,if we had taken out all those ingredients,3GXlvP4kLHg
533160,536160,"the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated,",3GXlvP4kLHg
536160,538160,we wouldn't have much on our plate.,3GXlvP4kLHg
538160,541160,"So if we did not have bees, it's not like we would starve,",3GXlvP4kLHg
541160,546160,but clearly our diet would be diminished.,3GXlvP4kLHg
546160,549160,"It's said that for bees, the flower is the fountain of life,",3GXlvP4kLHg
549160,552160,and for flowers bees are the messengers of love.,3GXlvP4kLHg
552160,555160,"And that's a really great expression, because really,",3GXlvP4kLHg
555160,558160,"bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know --",3GXlvP4kLHg
558160,560160,they get paid for their services.,3GXlvP4kLHg
560160,562160,"They get paid by pollen and nectar,",3GXlvP4kLHg
562160,566160,"to move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower.",3GXlvP4kLHg
566160,569160,And there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't --,3GXlvP4kLHg
569160,573160,the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves.,3GXlvP4kLHg
573160,576160,"So in an apple orchard, for instance, you'll have rows of 10 apples",3GXlvP4kLHg
576160,579160,"of one variety, and then you have another apple tree",3GXlvP4kLHg
579160,581160,that's a different type of pollen.,3GXlvP4kLHg
581160,582160,And bees are very faithful.,3GXlvP4kLHg
582160,586160,"When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower,",3GXlvP4kLHg
586160,590160,"they stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate.",3GXlvP4kLHg
590160,594160,"And of course, they're made to carry this pollen.",3GXlvP4kLHg
594160,597160,They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them,3GXlvP4kLHg
597160,601160,and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom.,3GXlvP4kLHg
601160,603160,"However, honeybees are a minority.",3GXlvP4kLHg
603160,606160,Honeybees are not native to America; they were introduced,3GXlvP4kLHg
606160,607160,with the colonialists.,3GXlvP4kLHg
607160,610160,And there are actually more species of bees,3GXlvP4kLHg
610160,612160,than there are mammals and birds combined.,3GXlvP4kLHg
612160,617160,"In Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years,",3GXlvP4kLHg
617160,620160,and very intensely in the last three years.,3GXlvP4kLHg
620160,625160,We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania.,3GXlvP4kLHg
625160,631160,Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.,3GXlvP4kLHg
631160,634160,"Now, that could be because we haven't been sampling right,",3GXlvP4kLHg
634160,636160,"but it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong",3GXlvP4kLHg
636160,639160,with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating.,3GXlvP4kLHg
639160,641160,We have bumblebees on the top.,3GXlvP4kLHg
641160,644160,"And bumblebees are what we call eusocial: they're not truly social,",3GXlvP4kLHg
644160,647160,"because only the queen is, over winter.",3GXlvP4kLHg
647160,650160,"We also have the sweat bees, and these are little gems flying around.",3GXlvP4kLHg
650160,653160,They're like tiny little flies and they fly around.,3GXlvP4kLHg
653160,657160,"And then you have another type of bee, which we call kleptoparasites,",3GXlvP4kLHg
657160,665160,"which is a very fancy way of saying, bad-minded, murdering --",3GXlvP4kLHg
665160,668160,what's the word I'm looking for? Murdering --,3GXlvP4kLHg
668160,669160,Audience: Bee?,3GXlvP4kLHg
669160,670160,"Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.",3GXlvP4kLHg
670160,672160,(Laughter),3GXlvP4kLHg
672160,679160,"What these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees,",3GXlvP4kLHg
679160,682160,"they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch,",3GXlvP4kLHg
682160,684160,"and they collect pollen and make it into a ball,",3GXlvP4kLHg
684160,686160,and they lay an egg on it.,3GXlvP4kLHg
686160,687160,"Well, these bees hang out at that hole,",3GXlvP4kLHg
687160,691160,"and they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg,",3GXlvP4kLHg
691160,694160,and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work.,3GXlvP4kLHg
694160,699160,"And so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees,",3GXlvP4kLHg
699160,701160,"you know that your environment is healthy,",3GXlvP4kLHg
701160,704160,because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees.,3GXlvP4kLHg

712160,715160,"are a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees.",3GXlvP4kLHg
715160,717160,"And in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast,",3GXlvP4kLHg
717160,720160,"go to these websites here, and they're really looking for people",3GXlvP4kLHg
720160,723160,"to look for some of these bumblebees, because we think",3GXlvP4kLHg
723160,727160,"some have gone extinct. Or some, the population has declined.",3GXlvP4kLHg
727160,730160,"And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble,",3GXlvP4kLHg

733160,736160,or all those other parts of our community.,3GXlvP4kLHg
736160,740160,"And of course, bees are not the only important factor here.",3GXlvP4kLHg
740160,742160,"There are other animals that pollinate, like bats,",3GXlvP4kLHg

744160,746160,"And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man,",3GXlvP4kLHg
746160,750160,because there's no money to research the bat problems.,3GXlvP4kLHg
750160,753160,And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.,3GXlvP4kLHg
753160,756160,White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats.,3GXlvP4kLHg
756160,761160,"If there's a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it,",3GXlvP4kLHg
761160,765160,"and there are 1,000 left. That's like San Francisco",3GXlvP4kLHg
765160,770160,becoming the population of half of this county in three years.,3GXlvP4kLHg
770160,772160,And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that.,3GXlvP4kLHg
772160,774160,But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause,3GXlvP4kLHg
774160,778160,"of all these conditions, and that cause is NDD:",3GXlvP4kLHg
778160,780160,Nature Deficit Disorder.,3GXlvP4kLHg
780160,784160,"And that is that I think that what we have in our society is,",3GXlvP4kLHg
784160,786160,we forgot our connection with nature.,3GXlvP4kLHg
786160,789160,"And I think if we reconnect to nature,",3GXlvP4kLHg
789160,792160,we'll be able to have the resources and that interest,3GXlvP4kLHg
792160,794160,to solve these problems.,3GXlvP4kLHg
794160,797160,And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.,3GXlvP4kLHg
797160,801160,"And that is, make meadows and not lawns.",3GXlvP4kLHg
801160,803160,"And I think we have lost our connection,",3GXlvP4kLHg
803160,807160,and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.,3GXlvP4kLHg
807160,809160,I've had the privilege of living by a meadow,3GXlvP4kLHg
809160,813160,"for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.",3GXlvP4kLHg
813160,818160,"And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.",3GXlvP4kLHg
818160,820160,"It used to be, two, three hundred years ago,",3GXlvP4kLHg
820160,822160,"that a lawn was a symbol of prestige,",3GXlvP4kLHg
822160,825160,and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green,3GXlvP4kLHg
825160,828160,"actually, deserts: they're totally sterile.",3GXlvP4kLHg
828160,833160,"Americans spent, in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns.",3GXlvP4kLHg
833160,839160,Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns.,3GXlvP4kLHg
839160,842160,And so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent,3GXlvP4kLHg
842160,846160,"keeping our lawns, which are these useless biosystems.",3GXlvP4kLHg
846160,849160,And so we need to rethink this idea.,3GXlvP4kLHg
849160,851160,"In fact, you know, the White House",3GXlvP4kLHg
851160,853160,used to have sheep in front in order to help fund,3GXlvP4kLHg
853160,856160,"the war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea;",3GXlvP4kLHg
856160,857160,it wouldn't be a bad idea.,3GXlvP4kLHg
857160,860160,I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns.,3GXlvP4kLHg
860160,864160,I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns,3GXlvP4kLHg
864160,868160,"at a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that.",3GXlvP4kLHg
868160,870160,"But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here,",3GXlvP4kLHg
870160,875160,because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.,3GXlvP4kLHg
875160,879160,That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.,3GXlvP4kLHg
879160,881160,These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow,3GXlvP4kLHg
881160,885160,"over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants,",3GXlvP4kLHg
885160,889160,"or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that --",3GXlvP4kLHg
889160,892160,"and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine,",3GXlvP4kLHg
892160,895160,this companion you can have as it matures,3GXlvP4kLHg
895160,897160,and as it has these different fragrances.,3GXlvP4kLHg
897160,899160,"And this is a companion,",3GXlvP4kLHg
899160,902160,and this is a relationship that never dries up.,3GXlvP4kLHg
902160,906160,"You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine, too.",3GXlvP4kLHg
906160,909160,And I encourage you to look at that.,3GXlvP4kLHg
909160,911160,"Now, not all of us have meadows,",3GXlvP4kLHg
911160,914160,"or lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course,",3GXlvP4kLHg
914160,916160,grow a meadow in a pot.,3GXlvP4kLHg
916160,919160,"Bees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things.",3GXlvP4kLHg
919160,923160,"So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot,",3GXlvP4kLHg
923160,926160,but a pot in a meadow.,3GXlvP4kLHg
926160,929160,But you can also have this great community of city,3GXlvP4kLHg
929160,932160,"or building-top beekeepers, these beekeepers that live --",3GXlvP4kLHg
932160,935160,This is in Paris where these beekeepers live.,3GXlvP4kLHg
935160,937160,"And everyone should open a beehive,",3GXlvP4kLHg
937160,940160,"because it is the most amazing, incredible thing.",3GXlvP4kLHg
940160,943160,"And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD, or Nature Deficit Disorder,",3GXlvP4kLHg
943160,945160,I think this is a great way of doing it.,3GXlvP4kLHg
945160,947160,"Get a beehive and grow a meadow,",3GXlvP4kLHg
947160,950160,and watch that life come back into your life.,3GXlvP4kLHg
950160,954160,"And so with that, I think that what we can do, if we do this,",3GXlvP4kLHg
954160,957160,we can make sure that our future -- our more perfect future --,3GXlvP4kLHg
957160,962160,includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows.,3GXlvP4kLHg
962160,965160,And that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs,3GXlvP4kLHg
965160,968160,as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees,3GXlvP4kLHg
968160,972160,or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one.,3GXlvP4kLHg
972160,973160,And I hope that you experience it,3GXlvP4kLHg

566946.0,568637.0,Just above Brazil,N8Votwxx8a0
568637.0,570956.0,is a social progress superpower —,N8Votwxx8a0

582364.0,583818.0,"So let me take away these countries,",N8Votwxx8a0
583818.0,586732.0,and then pop in the regression line.,N8Votwxx8a0
586732.0,588385.0,So this shows the average relationship,N8Votwxx8a0
588385.0,590896.0,between GDP and social progress.,N8Votwxx8a0
590896.0,593138.0,"The first thing to notice,",N8Votwxx8a0
593138.0,594993.0,is that there's lots of noise,N8Votwxx8a0
594993.0,596690.0,around the trend line.,N8Votwxx8a0
596690.0,598275.0,"And what this shows,",N8Votwxx8a0
598275.0,601157.0,"what this empirically demonstrates,",N8Votwxx8a0
601157.0,604192.0,is that GDP is not destiny.,N8Votwxx8a0
604192.0,607395.0,"At every level of GDP per capita,",N8Votwxx8a0
607395.0,610593.0,"there are opportunities

610593.0,612596.0,risks of less.,N8Votwxx8a0
612596.0,614056.0,The second thing to notice,N8Votwxx8a0
614056.0,616559.0,"is that for poor countries,",N8Votwxx8a0
616559.0,618532.0,the curve is really steep.,N8Votwxx8a0
618532.0,619807.0,So what this tells us is that,N8Votwxx8a0
619807.0,621060.0,if poor countries can get,N8Votwxx8a0
621060.0,622954.0,"a little bit of extra GDP,",N8Votwxx8a0
622954.0,624737.0,and if they reinvest that,N8Votwxx8a0
624737.0,627409.0,"in doctors, nurses, water supplies,",N8Votwxx8a0
627409.0,628782.0,"sanitation, etc.,",N8Votwxx8a0
628782.0,630801.0,there's a lot of social progress bang,N8Votwxx8a0
630801.0,632387.0,for your GDP buck.,N8Votwxx8a0
632387.0,635962.0,"And that's good news, and that's what
we've seen over the last 20, 30 years,",N8Votwxx8a0
635962.0,637963.0,with a lot of people lifted out of poverty,N8Votwxx8a0
637963.0,640173.0,by economic growth and good policies,N8Votwxx8a0
640173.0,642045.0,in poorer countries.,N8Votwxx8a0
642045.0,644242.0,"But go on a bit further up the curve,",N8Votwxx8a0
644242.0,646351.0,and then we see it flattening out.,N8Votwxx8a0
646351.0,648603.0,Each extra dollar of GDP,N8Votwxx8a0
648603.0,651839.0,is buying less and less social progress.,N8Votwxx8a0
651839.0,654513.0,"And with more and more
of the world's population",N8Votwxx8a0
654513.0,657076.0,"living on this part of the curve,",N8Votwxx8a0
657076.0,659300.0,it means GDP is becoming,N8Votwxx8a0
659300.0,661084.0,less and less useful,N8Votwxx8a0
661084.0,663600.0,as a guide to our development.,N8Votwxx8a0
663600.0,665747.0,I'll show you an example of Brazil.,N8Votwxx8a0
665747.0,666970.0,Here's Brazil:,N8Votwxx8a0
666970.0,669837.0,"social progress of about 70 out of 100,",N8Votwxx8a0
669841.0,672335.0,"GDP per capita about
14,000 dollars a year.",N8Votwxx8a0
672335.0,675256.0,"And look, Brazil's above the line.",N8Votwxx8a0
675256.0,677142.0,Brazil is doing a reasonably good job,N8Votwxx8a0
677142.0,680467.0,of turning GDP into social progress.,N8Votwxx8a0
680467.0,682454.0,But where does Brazil go next?,N8Votwxx8a0
682454.0,683966.0,Let's say that Brazil,N8Votwxx8a0
683966.0,685738.0,adopts a bold economic plan,N8Votwxx8a0
685738.0,688041.0,to double GDP in the next decade.,N8Votwxx8a0
688041.0,691657.0,But that is only half a plan.,N8Votwxx8a0
691657.0,693934.0,"It's less than half a plan,",N8Votwxx8a0
693934.0,697182.0,"because where does Brazil
want to go on social progress?",N8Votwxx8a0
697186.0,699504.0,"Brazil, it's possible",N8Votwxx8a0
699504.0,701239.0,"to increase your growth,",N8Votwxx8a0
701239.0,702816.0,"increase your GDP,",N8Votwxx8a0
702816.0,704706.0,while stagnating or going backwards,N8Votwxx8a0
704706.0,706055.0,on social progress.,N8Votwxx8a0
706055.0,707241.0,We don't want Brazil,N8Votwxx8a0
707241.0,708973.0,to become like Russia.,N8Votwxx8a0
708973.0,711288.0,What you really want is for Brazil,N8Votwxx8a0
711288.0,716241.0,"to get ever more efficient at creating
social progress from its GDP,",N8Votwxx8a0
716241.0,718539.0,so it becomes more like New Zealand.,N8Votwxx8a0
718539.0,720119.0,And what that means is that,N8Votwxx8a0
720119.0,722776.0,Brazil needs to prioritize social progress,N8Votwxx8a0
722776.0,724468.0,in its development plan,N8Votwxx8a0
724468.0,726880.0,"and see that it's not just growth alone,",N8Votwxx8a0

61260,63260,"Well actually, I think the answer",60OVlfAUPJg
63260,65260,is staring us right in the face:,60OVlfAUPJg
65260,67260,Use computers.,60OVlfAUPJg
67260,69260,I believe,60OVlfAUPJg

73260,76260,for making math education work.,60OVlfAUPJg
76260,78260,"So to explain that,",60OVlfAUPJg
78260,81260,let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world,60OVlfAUPJg
81260,83260,and what it looks like in education.,60OVlfAUPJg
83260,85260,"See, in the real world",60OVlfAUPJg
85260,88260,math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.,60OVlfAUPJg
88260,90260,"It's done by geologists,",60OVlfAUPJg
90260,92260,"engineers, biologists,",60OVlfAUPJg

94260,96260,modeling and simulation.,60OVlfAUPJg
96260,98260,It's actually very popular.,60OVlfAUPJg
98260,101260,But in education it looks very different --,60OVlfAUPJg
101260,103260,"dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating,",60OVlfAUPJg
103260,105260,mostly by hand.,60OVlfAUPJg
106260,108260,Lots of things that seem simple,60OVlfAUPJg
108260,110260,"and not difficult like in the real world,",60OVlfAUPJg
110260,112260,except if you're learning it.,60OVlfAUPJg
113260,115260,And another thing about math:,60OVlfAUPJg
115260,117260,math sometimes looks like math --,60OVlfAUPJg
117260,120260,like in this example here --,60OVlfAUPJg
120260,122260,and sometimes it doesn't --,60OVlfAUPJg
122260,125260,"like Am I drunk?""""",60OVlfAUPJg
127260,130260,And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.,60OVlfAUPJg
130260,133260,You wouldn't have expected that a few years back.,60OVlfAUPJg
133260,136260,But now you can find out all about --,60OVlfAUPJg
136260,139260,"unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but --",60OVlfAUPJg
139260,141260,all about what happens.,60OVlfAUPJg
141260,143260,"So let's zoom out a bit and ask,",60OVlfAUPJg
143260,145260,why are we teaching people math?,60OVlfAUPJg
145260,148260,What's the point of teaching people math?,60OVlfAUPJg
148260,151260,"And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?",60OVlfAUPJg

164260,167260,"what I call everyday living"" --""",60OVlfAUPJg
168260,170260,"to function in the world today,",60OVlfAUPJg
170260,172260,"you've got to be pretty quantitative,",60OVlfAUPJg
172260,174260,much more so than a few years ago:,60OVlfAUPJg
174260,176260,"figure out your mortgages,",60OVlfAUPJg
176260,179260,"being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things --",60OVlfAUPJg
180260,183260,"and thirdly, what I would call something like",60OVlfAUPJg
183260,186260,"logical mind training, logical thinking.",60OVlfAUPJg
186260,188260,Over the years,60OVlfAUPJg
188260,190260,we've put so much in society,60OVlfAUPJg
190260,193260,into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society.,60OVlfAUPJg
193260,195260,It's very important to learn that,60OVlfAUPJg
195260,197260,math is a great way to do that.,60OVlfAUPJg
197260,199260,So let's ask another question.,60OVlfAUPJg
199260,201260,What is math?,60OVlfAUPJg
201260,203260,"What do we mean when we say we're doing math,",60OVlfAUPJg
203260,205260,or educating people to do math?,60OVlfAUPJg
205260,208260,"Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking,",60OVlfAUPJg
208260,210260,starting with posing the right question.,60OVlfAUPJg
210260,213260,What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?,60OVlfAUPJg
213260,215260,"And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world,",60OVlfAUPJg
215260,218260,beyond virtually any other part of doing math.,60OVlfAUPJg
218260,220260,"People ask the wrong question,",60OVlfAUPJg
220260,222260,"and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer,",60OVlfAUPJg
222260,224260,"for that reason, if not for others.",60OVlfAUPJg
224260,226260,So the next thing is take that problem,60OVlfAUPJg
226260,228260,and turn it from a real world problem,60OVlfAUPJg
228260,230260,into a math problem.,60OVlfAUPJg
230260,232260,That's stage two.,60OVlfAUPJg
232260,235260,"Once you've done that, then there's the computation step.",60OVlfAUPJg
235260,237260,Turn it from that into some answer,60OVlfAUPJg
237260,240260,in a mathematical form.,60OVlfAUPJg
240260,242260,"And of course, math is very powerful at doing that.",60OVlfAUPJg
242260,244260,"And then finally, turn it back to the real world.",60OVlfAUPJg
244260,246260,Did it answer the question?,60OVlfAUPJg
246260,249260,And also verify it -- crucial step.,60OVlfAUPJg
250260,252260,Now here's the crazy thing right now.,60OVlfAUPJg
252260,254260,"In math education,",60OVlfAUPJg
254260,257260,we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time,60OVlfAUPJg
257260,260260,teaching people to do step three by hand.,60OVlfAUPJg
260260,262260,"Yet, that's the one step computers can do",60OVlfAUPJg
262260,265260,better than any human after years of practice.,60OVlfAUPJg
265260,268260,"Instead, we ought to be using computers",60OVlfAUPJg
268260,270260,to do step three,60OVlfAUPJg
270260,273260,and using the students to spend much more effort,60OVlfAUPJg
273260,275260,"on learning how to do steps one, two and four --",60OVlfAUPJg
275260,278260,"conceptualizing problems, applying them,",60OVlfAUPJg
278260,281260,getting the teacher to run them through how to do that.,60OVlfAUPJg
281260,283260,"See, crucial point here:",60OVlfAUPJg
283260,285260,math is not equal to calculating.,60OVlfAUPJg
285260,288260,Math is a much broader subject than calculating.,60OVlfAUPJg
288260,291260,Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined,60OVlfAUPJg
291260,293260,over hundreds of years.,60OVlfAUPJg
293260,296260,There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.,60OVlfAUPJg
296260,298260,But in the last few decades,60OVlfAUPJg
298260,300260,that has totally changed.,60OVlfAUPJg
300260,303260,We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject,60OVlfAUPJg
303260,306260,that I could ever imagine with computers.,60OVlfAUPJg
307260,309260,"Calculating was typically the limiting step,",60OVlfAUPJg
309260,311260,and now often it isn't.,60OVlfAUPJg
311260,313260,So I think in terms of the fact that math,60OVlfAUPJg
313260,316260,has been liberated from calculating.,60OVlfAUPJg
316260,319260,But that math liberation didn't get into education yet.,60OVlfAUPJg
319260,321260,"See, I think of calculating, in a sense,",60OVlfAUPJg
321260,323260,as the machinery of math.,60OVlfAUPJg
323260,325260,It's the chore.,60OVlfAUPJg
325260,328260,"It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.",60OVlfAUPJg
329260,332260,"It's a means to an end, not an end in itself,",60OVlfAUPJg
334260,336260,and automation allows us,60OVlfAUPJg
336260,338260,to have that machinery.,60OVlfAUPJg
338260,340260,Computers allow us to do that --,60OVlfAUPJg
340260,343260,and this is not a small problem by any means.,60OVlfAUPJg
343260,346260,"I estimated that, just today, across the world,",60OVlfAUPJg
346260,349260,we spent about 106 average world lifetimes,60OVlfAUPJg
349260,352260,teaching people how to calculate by hand.,60OVlfAUPJg
352260,355260,That's an amazing amount of human endeavor.,60OVlfAUPJg
355260,357260,So we better be damn sure --,60OVlfAUPJg
357260,360260,"and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them --",60OVlfAUPJg
360260,362260,so we better be damn sure,60OVlfAUPJg
362260,364260,that we know why we're doing that,60OVlfAUPJg
364260,366260,and it has a real purpose.,60OVlfAUPJg
366260,368260,I think we should be assuming computers,60OVlfAUPJg
368260,370260,for doing the calculating,60OVlfAUPJg
370260,373260,and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.,60OVlfAUPJg
373260,375260,And I think there are some cases.,60OVlfAUPJg
375260,377260,For example: mental arithmetic.,60OVlfAUPJg
377260,380260,"I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating.",60OVlfAUPJg
380260,382260,"People say, Is such and such true?""""",60OVlfAUPJg
382260,384260,"And I'll say, Hmm, not sure."" I'll think about it roughly.""",60OVlfAUPJg
384260,386260,It's still quicker to do that and more practical.,60OVlfAUPJg
386260,388260,So I think practicality is one case,60OVlfAUPJg
388260,390260,where it's worth teaching people by hand.,60OVlfAUPJg
390260,392260,And then there are certain conceptual things,60OVlfAUPJg
392260,394260,"that can also benefit from hand calculating,",60OVlfAUPJg
394260,396260,but I think they're relatively small in number.,60OVlfAUPJg
396260,398260,One thing I often ask about,60OVlfAUPJg
398260,401260,is ancient Greek and how this relates.,60OVlfAUPJg
401260,403260,"See, the thing we're doing right now",60OVlfAUPJg
403260,405260,is we're forcing people to learn mathematics.,60OVlfAUPJg
405260,407260,It's a major subject.,60OVlfAUPJg
407260,410260,"I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating",60OVlfAUPJg
410260,412260,or in following their own interests,60OVlfAUPJg
412260,414260,in any subject however bizarre --,60OVlfAUPJg
414260,416260,they should do that.,60OVlfAUPJg
416260,418260,"That's absolutely the right thing,",60OVlfAUPJg
418260,420260,for people to follow their self-interest.,60OVlfAUPJg
420260,422260,"I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek,",60OVlfAUPJg
422260,425260,but I don't think that we should force the entire population,60OVlfAUPJg
425260,427260,to learn a subject like ancient Greek.,60OVlfAUPJg
427260,429260,I don't think it's warranted.,60OVlfAUPJg
429260,432260,So I have this distinction between what we're making people do,60OVlfAUPJg
432260,434260,and the subject that's sort of mainstream,60OVlfAUPJg
434260,437260,"and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest",60OVlfAUPJg
437260,439260,and perhaps even be spiked into doing that.,60OVlfAUPJg
439260,442260,So what are the issues people bring up with this?,60OVlfAUPJg
442260,445260,"Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.",60OVlfAUPJg
445260,447260,You shouldn't use the machine,60OVlfAUPJg
447260,449260,until you get the basics of the subject.,60OVlfAUPJg
449260,452260,"So my usual question is, what do you mean by basics?""""",60OVlfAUPJg
452260,454260,Basics of what?,60OVlfAUPJg
454260,456260,Are the basics of driving a car,60OVlfAUPJg
456260,459260,"learning how to service it, or design it for that matter?",60OVlfAUPJg
459260,462260,Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?,60OVlfAUPJg
463260,465260,I don't think so.,60OVlfAUPJg
465260,468260,I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do,60OVlfAUPJg
468260,470260,from how it gets done,60OVlfAUPJg
470260,473260,and the machinery of how it gets done,60OVlfAUPJg
474260,477260,and automation allows you to make that separation.,60OVlfAUPJg
477260,480260,"A hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car",60OVlfAUPJg
480260,482260,you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car,60OVlfAUPJg
482260,485260,and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things.,60OVlfAUPJg
486260,488260,But automation in cars,60OVlfAUPJg
488260,490260,"allowed that to separate,",60OVlfAUPJg
490260,493260,"so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak,",60OVlfAUPJg
493260,496260,from engineering of the car,60OVlfAUPJg
496260,499260,or learning how to service it.,60OVlfAUPJg
500260,502260,So automation allows this separation,60OVlfAUPJg
502260,504260,"and also allows -- in the case of driving,",60OVlfAUPJg
504260,506260,and I believe also in the future case of maths --,60OVlfAUPJg
506260,508260,a democratized way of doing that.,60OVlfAUPJg
508260,510260,It can be spread across a much larger number of people,60OVlfAUPJg
510260,513260,who can really work with that.,60OVlfAUPJg
513260,515260,So there's another thing that comes up with basics.,60OVlfAUPJg
515260,517260,"People confuse, in my view,",60OVlfAUPJg
517260,520260,the order of the invention of the tools,60OVlfAUPJg
520260,523260,with the order in which they should use them for teaching.,60OVlfAUPJg
523260,526260,"So just because paper was invented before computers,",60OVlfAUPJg
526260,529260,it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject,60OVlfAUPJg
529260,531260,by using paper instead of a computer,60OVlfAUPJg
531260,533260,to teach mathematics.,60OVlfAUPJg
535260,538260,My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.,60OVlfAUPJg
538260,541260,"She enjoys making what she calls paper laptops.""""",60OVlfAUPJg
541260,543260,(Laughter),60OVlfAUPJg
543260,545260,"So I asked her one day, You know, when I was your age,""",60OVlfAUPJg
545260,547260,I didn't make these.,60OVlfAUPJg
547260,549260,"Why do you think that was?""
217;549260;551260;And after a second or two, carefully reflecting,""",60OVlfAUPJg
551260,553260,"she said, No paper?""""",60OVlfAUPJg
553260,558260,(Laughter),60OVlfAUPJg
559260,561260,"If you were born after computers and paper,",60OVlfAUPJg
561260,564260,"it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in,",60OVlfAUPJg
564260,566260,you just want to have the best tool.,60OVlfAUPJg
566260,569260,"So another one that comes up is Computers dumb math down.""""",60OVlfAUPJg
569260,571260,"That somehow, if you use a computer,",60OVlfAUPJg
571260,573260,"it's all mindless button-pushing,",60OVlfAUPJg
573260,575260,"but if you do it by hand,",60OVlfAUPJg
575260,577260,it's all intellectual.,60OVlfAUPJg
577260,580260,"This one kind of annoys me, I must say.",60OVlfAUPJg
580260,582260,Do we really believe,60OVlfAUPJg
582260,584260,that the math that most people are doing in school,60OVlfAUPJg
584260,586260,practically today,60OVlfAUPJg
586260,588260,is more than applying procedures,60OVlfAUPJg
588260,591260,"to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get?",60OVlfAUPJg
591260,593260,I don't think so.,60OVlfAUPJg
593260,596260,"And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.",60OVlfAUPJg
596260,599260,"Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.",60OVlfAUPJg
599260,602260,"When they're out of education, they do it on a computer.",60OVlfAUPJg
602260,605260,"Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem,",60OVlfAUPJg
605260,607260,actually make it more conceptual.,60OVlfAUPJg
607260,609260,"Now, of course, like any great tool,",60OVlfAUPJg
609260,611260,"they can be used completely mindlessly,",60OVlfAUPJg
611260,614260,"like turning everything into a multimedia show,",60OVlfAUPJg
614260,617260,"like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand,",60OVlfAUPJg
617260,619260,where the computer was the teacher --,60OVlfAUPJg
619260,622260,show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.,60OVlfAUPJg
622260,624260,This is just nuts.,60OVlfAUPJg
624260,627260,Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand,60OVlfAUPJg
627260,629260,that the computer should be doing anyway?,60OVlfAUPJg
629260,631260,All backwards.,60OVlfAUPJg
631260,633260,Let me show you,60OVlfAUPJg
633260,636260,that you can also make problems harder to calculate.,60OVlfAUPJg
636260,638260,"See, normally in school,",60OVlfAUPJg
638260,641260,you do things like solve quadratic equations.,60OVlfAUPJg
641260,644260,"But you see, when you're using a computer,",60OVlfAUPJg
644260,648260,you can just substitute.,60OVlfAUPJg
648260,650260,"You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise.",60OVlfAUPJg
650260,652260,Same principles applied --,60OVlfAUPJg
652260,654260,"calculations, harder.",60OVlfAUPJg
654260,656260,And problems in the real world,60OVlfAUPJg
656260,658260,look nutty and horrible like this.,60OVlfAUPJg
658260,660260,They've got hair all over them.,60OVlfAUPJg
660260,663260,"They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.",60OVlfAUPJg
664260,666260,And think of the outside world.,60OVlfAUPJg
666260,668260,Do we really believe that engineering and biology,60OVlfAUPJg
668260,670260,and all of these other things,60OVlfAUPJg
670260,672260,that have so benefited from computers and maths,60OVlfAUPJg
672260,675260,have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?,60OVlfAUPJg
675260,678260,I don't think so -- quite the opposite.,60OVlfAUPJg
678260,681260,So the problem we've really got in math education,60OVlfAUPJg
681260,684260,"is not that computers might dumb it down,",60OVlfAUPJg
684260,687260,but that we have dumbed-down problems right now.,60OVlfAUPJg
687260,689260,"Well, another issue people bring up",60OVlfAUPJg
689260,691260,is somehow that hand calculating procedures,60OVlfAUPJg
691260,693260,teach understanding.,60OVlfAUPJg
693260,695260,"So if you go through lots of examples,",60OVlfAUPJg
695260,697260,"you can get the answer,",60OVlfAUPJg
697260,700260,you can understand how the basics of the system work better.,60OVlfAUPJg
700260,703260,"I think there is one thing that I think very valid here,",60OVlfAUPJg
703260,706260,which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.,60OVlfAUPJg
707260,710260,But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.,60OVlfAUPJg
710260,713260,It's called programming.,60OVlfAUPJg
713260,715260,Programming is how most procedures and processes,60OVlfAUPJg
715260,717260,"get written down these days,",60OVlfAUPJg
717260,719260,and it's also a great way,60OVlfAUPJg
719260,721260,to engage students much more,60OVlfAUPJg
721260,723260,and to check they really understand.,60OVlfAUPJg
723260,725260,If you really want to check you understand math,60OVlfAUPJg
725260,728260,then write a program to do it.,60OVlfAUPJg
728260,731260,So programming is the way I think we should be doing that.,60OVlfAUPJg
731260,733260,"So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here",60OVlfAUPJg
733260,735260,is we have a unique opportunity,60OVlfAUPJg
735260,737260,to make maths both more practical,60OVlfAUPJg
737260,740260,"and more conceptual, simultaneously.",60OVlfAUPJg
740260,743260,I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.,60OVlfAUPJg
743260,745260,It's usually some kind of choice,60OVlfAUPJg
745260,747260,between the vocational and the intellectual.,60OVlfAUPJg
747260,750260,But I think we can do both at the same time here.,60OVlfAUPJg
752260,755260,And we open up so many more possibilities.,60OVlfAUPJg
755260,757260,You can do so many more problems.,60OVlfAUPJg
757260,759260,What I really think we gain from this,60OVlfAUPJg
759260,762260,is students getting intuition and experience,60OVlfAUPJg
762260,765260,in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.,60OVlfAUPJg
765260,767260,And experience of harder problems --,60OVlfAUPJg
767260,769260,"being able to play with the math, interact with it,",60OVlfAUPJg
769260,771260,feel it.,60OVlfAUPJg
771260,774260,We want people who can feel the math instinctively.,60OVlfAUPJg
774260,777260,That's what computers allow us to do.,60OVlfAUPJg
777260,780260,Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.,60OVlfAUPJg
780260,782260,"Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate,",60OVlfAUPJg
782260,784260,but now we can reorder it,60OVlfAUPJg
784260,786260,"by how difficult it is to understand the concepts,",60OVlfAUPJg
786260,788260,however hard the calculating.,60OVlfAUPJg
788260,791260,So calculus has traditionally been taught very late.,60OVlfAUPJg
791260,793260,Why is this?,60OVlfAUPJg
793260,796260,"Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.",60OVlfAUPJg
797260,799260,But actually many of the concepts,60OVlfAUPJg
799260,802260,are amenable to a much younger age group.,60OVlfAUPJg
802260,805260,This was an example I built for my daughter.,60OVlfAUPJg
805260,807260,"And very, very simple.",60OVlfAUPJg
808260,810260,We were talking about what happens,60OVlfAUPJg
810260,812260,when you increase the number of sides of a polygon,60OVlfAUPJg
812260,814260,to a very large number.,60OVlfAUPJg
816260,818260,"And of course, it turns into a circle.",60OVlfAUPJg
818260,820260,"And by the way, she was also very insistent",60OVlfAUPJg
820260,822260,"on being able to change the color,",60OVlfAUPJg
822260,825260,an important feature for this demonstration.,60OVlfAUPJg
826260,829260,You can see that this is a very early step,60OVlfAUPJg
829260,831260,into limits and differential calculus,60OVlfAUPJg
831260,834260,and what happens when you take things to an extreme --,60OVlfAUPJg
834260,836260,and very small sides and a very large number of sides.,60OVlfAUPJg
836260,838260,Very simple example.,60OVlfAUPJg
838260,840260,That's a view of the world,60OVlfAUPJg
840260,843260,"that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.",60OVlfAUPJg
843260,846260,"And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.",60OVlfAUPJg
846260,849260,So one of the roadblocks we have,60OVlfAUPJg
849260,852260,in moving this agenda forward,60OVlfAUPJg
852260,854260,is exams.,60OVlfAUPJg
854260,857260,"In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams,",60OVlfAUPJg
857260,860260,it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed,60OVlfAUPJg
860260,862260,to a point where they can use computers,60OVlfAUPJg
862260,865260,during the semesters.,60OVlfAUPJg
865260,867260,And one of the reasons it's so important --,60OVlfAUPJg
867260,870260,so it's very important to get computers in exams.,60OVlfAUPJg
870260,873260,"And then we can ask questions, real questions,",60OVlfAUPJg
873260,876260,"questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? --",60OVlfAUPJg
876260,879260,real questions that people have in their everyday lives.,60OVlfAUPJg
880260,882260,"And you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here.",60OVlfAUPJg
882260,885260,This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.,60OVlfAUPJg
885260,887260,How many years of protection do I need?,60OVlfAUPJg
887260,889260,What does that do to the payments,60OVlfAUPJg
889260,892260,and to the interest rates and so forth?,60OVlfAUPJg
892260,895260,Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question,60OVlfAUPJg
895260,897260,"that should be asked in exams,",60OVlfAUPJg
897260,899260,but I think it's a very important type,60OVlfAUPJg
899260,902260,that right now just gets completely ignored,60OVlfAUPJg
902260,905260,and is critical for people's real understanding.,60OVlfAUPJg
905260,908260,So I believe [there is] critical reform,60OVlfAUPJg

922260,925260,This isn't some optional extra.,60OVlfAUPJg
925260,927260,And the country that does this first,60OVlfAUPJg

956260,958260,And let's understand:,60OVlfAUPJg
958260,961260,this is not an incremental sort of change.,60OVlfAUPJg

a little bit of robot religion.",AO4In7d6X-c

is a machine where there's a computer",AO4In7d6X-c

404349,406753,But that's really only half of the story.,AO4In7d6X-c
406777,409886,"The real story is
that the computer is on one side,",AO4In7d6X-c

411878,414370,"and on the other side
are the physics of the world.",AO4In7d6X-c

friction, bouncing into things.",AO4In7d6X-c
420238,422073,"In order to have a successful robot,",AO4In7d6X-c
422097,426688,"my religion is that you have to do
a holistic design,",AO4In7d6X-c

the hardware and the behavior",AO4In7d6X-c
430289,431525,"all at one time,",AO4In7d6X-c
431549,435251,"and all these parts really intermesh

you get a real harmony",AO4In7d6X-c
438406,441285,"between all those parts
interacting with each other.",AO4In7d6X-c
442269,444529,"So it's half software and half hardware,",AO4In7d6X-c

450264,452741,"the picture on the left
is a conventional design,",AO4In7d6X-c

458453,460502,"And on the right
is a more integrated thing;",AO4In7d6X-c

465864,468501,we're starting to build parts of robots,AO4In7d6X-c

like the anatomy of an animal.",AO4In7d6X-c
471446,474790,"So that's an upper-leg part
that has hydraulic pathways --",AO4In7d6X-c

476768,479148,"all embedded, all printed as one piece,",AO4In7d6X-c
479172,482374,and the whole structure is developed,AO4In7d6X-c

and behavior are going to be,",AO4In7d6X-c

recorded from robots",AO4In7d6X-c
488385,490194,and simulations and things like that.,AO4In7d6X-c
490218,493155,So it's a data-driven hardware design.,AO4In7d6X-c

495297,497541,"not only the upper leg

better very quickly.",AO4In7d6X-c

a little bit of mobility,",AO4In7d6X-c
533338,534938,dexterity and perception.,AO4In7d6X-c
535681,539445,"This is Seth Davis,
who's my robot wrangler today,",AO4In7d6X-c

some general direction",AO4In7d6X-c

544383,547454,"but all the coordination

about a legged robot is,",AO4In7d6X-c

567355,570128,"In addition to going forward,
it can go sideways,",AO4In7d6X-c
571413,572853,it can turn in place.,AO4In7d6X-c

587104,588934,(Laughter),AO4In7d6X-c
589858,593094,"Now if it were really a show-off,
it would be hopping on one foot,",AO4In7d6X-c
593118,594286,"but, you know.",AO4In7d6X-c
594310,598353,"Now, Spot has a set of cameras
here, stereo cameras,",AO4In7d6X-c
598377,600207,and we have a feed up in the center.,AO4In7d6X-c
600591,602415,"It's kind of dark out in the audience,",AO4In7d6X-c
602439,605659,"but it's going to use those cameras
in order to look at the terrain",AO4In7d6X-c
605683,606856,"right in front of it,",AO4In7d6X-c
606880,609641,"while it goes over

609665,612978,"For this demo, Seth is steering,",AO4In7d6X-c
613002,615507,"but the robot's doing
all its own terrain planning.",AO4In7d6X-c
615531,617033,"This is a terrain map,",AO4In7d6X-c
617057,622227,"where the data from the cameras
is being developed in real time,",AO4In7d6X-c
622251,625488,"showing the red spots,
which are where it doesn't want to step,",AO4In7d6X-c
625512,627503,and the green spots are the good places.,AO4In7d6X-c
627527,629976,"And here it's treating
them like stepping-stones.",AO4In7d6X-c
630000,632755,"So it's trying to stay up on the blocks,",AO4In7d6X-c
632779,634052,"and it adjusts its stride,",AO4In7d6X-c
634076,635537,and there's a ton of planning,AO4In7d6X-c
635561,637802,"that has to go into
an operation like that,",AO4In7d6X-c
637826,640088,"and it does all
that planning in real time,",AO4In7d6X-c
640112,642542,"where it adjusts the steps
a little bit longer",AO4In7d6X-c
642566,643842,or a little bit shorter.,AO4In7d6X-c
645216,647646,"Now we're going to change it
into a different mode,",AO4In7d6X-c
647670,651093,"where it's just going to treat
the blocks like terrain",AO4In7d6X-c
651117,654836,and decide whether to step up or down,AO4In7d6X-c
654860,656145,as it goes.,AO4In7d6X-c
657085,660054,So this is using dynamic balance,AO4In7d6X-c
660078,661936,"and mobile perception,",AO4In7d6X-c
661960,667347,"because it has to coordinate what it sees
along with how it's moving.",AO4In7d6X-c
668988,673306,The other thing Spot has is a robot arm.,AO4In7d6X-c
674337,676827,"Some of you may see that
as a head and a neck,",AO4In7d6X-c
676851,678436,"but believe me, it's an arm.",AO4In7d6X-c
678460,680225,Seth is driving it around.,AO4In7d6X-c
680249,684017,"He's actually driving the hand
and the body is following.",AO4In7d6X-c
684041,688174,"So the two are coordinated
in the way I was talking about before --",AO4In7d6X-c
688198,690062,in the way people can do that.,AO4In7d6X-c

Spot can do we call, chicken-head mode,""""",AO4In7d6X-c
694753,697937,"and it keeps its head
in one place in space,",AO4In7d6X-c
697961,699806,and it moves its body all around.,AO4In7d6X-c
700553,703155,"There's a variation of this
that's called twerking"" --""",AO4In7d6X-c
703179,704195,(Laughter),AO4In7d6X-c

706066,707137,(Laughter),AO4In7d6X-c
707161,710747,"So, Spot: I'm feeling a little thirsty.
Could you get me a soda?",AO4In7d6X-c
711293,715066,"For this demo,
Seth is not doing any driving.",AO4In7d6X-c
715090,717203,"We have a LIDAR on the back of the robot,",AO4In7d6X-c
717227,719764,"and it's using these props
we've put on the stage",AO4In7d6X-c
719788,721181,to localize itself.,AO4In7d6X-c
721205,723486,It's gone over to that location.,AO4In7d6X-c
723510,726392,Now it's using a camera that's in its hand,AO4In7d6X-c
726416,728202,"to find the cup,",AO4In7d6X-c
728853,730108,picks it up --,AO4In7d6X-c
730132,732083,"and again, Seth's not driving.",AO4In7d6X-c
733372,736613,We've planned out a path for it to go --,AO4In7d6X-c
736637,738744,"it looked like it was
going off the path --",AO4In7d6X-c
738768,741126,"and now Seth's going
to take over control again,",AO4In7d6X-c
741150,744599,"because I'm a little bit chicken
about having it do this by itself.",AO4In7d6X-c
744623,745999,"Thank you, Spot.",AO4In7d6X-c

975260,977260,"it's about actually being in control,",R9g3Q-qvtss

504972,506859,"People who say, don't sit that team next to this team,",y5nbWUOc9tY

523364,525468,that does not work.,y5nbWUOc9tY
525468,528684,"So office sound is a huge area, and incidentally,",y5nbWUOc9tY

541252,544592,"Hey, let's all be interior sound designers,",y5nbWUOc9tY
544592,547409,take on listening to our rooms and designing sound,y5nbWUOc9tY

201971,204184,"that have to be downloaded

216293,219256,to actually make us move into space.,HQzXqjT0w3k
219256,222942,"And by doing that, we converted
these signals into digital commands",HQzXqjT0w3k
222942,227934,"that any mechanical, electronic,
or even a virtual device can understand",HQzXqjT0w3k
227934,234490,"so that the subject can imagine
what he, she or it wants to make move,",HQzXqjT0w3k

241845,243630,"as you are going to see in a moment,",HQzXqjT0w3k
243630,247099,"we actually sent messages
back to the brain to confirm",HQzXqjT0w3k
247099,251054,"that that voluntary motor will
was being enacted, no matter where --",HQzXqjT0w3k

to make us move.",HQzXqjT0w3k

285088,289130,"And to get a reward,
a drop of orange juice that monkeys love,",HQzXqjT0w3k

select one of these objects",HQzXqjT0w3k

294703,296355,"not by seeing it, by touching it,",HQzXqjT0w3k

touches one of the objects,",HQzXqjT0w3k
299400,302483,"an electrical pulse goes back

302483,306876,"describing the fine texture
of the surface of this object,",HQzXqjT0w3k

the correct object that he has to grab,",HQzXqjT0w3k

325017,329962,"we actually came and proposed the idea
that we had published 15 years ago.",HQzXqjT0w3k

331991,333960,"We got it out of the drawers,",HQzXqjT0w3k

interface to regain mobility.",HQzXqjT0w3k
342190,344368,The idea was that if you suffered --,HQzXqjT0w3k

of the spinal cord,",HQzXqjT0w3k
356697,360080,"you cannot move because your brainstorms
cannot reach your muscles.",HQzXqjT0w3k
360080,364330,"However, your brainstorms
continue to be generated in your head.",HQzXqjT0w3k
364330,368245,"Paraplegic, quadriplegic patients
dream about moving every night.",HQzXqjT0w3k
368245,370397,They have that inside their head.,HQzXqjT0w3k
370397,373738,"The problem is how
to get that code out of it",HQzXqjT0w3k
373738,376662,and make the movement be created again.,HQzXqjT0w3k
376662,379883,"So what we proposed was,
let's create a new body.",HQzXqjT0w3k
379883,381619,Let's create a robotic vest.,HQzXqjT0w3k
381619,386462,"And that's exactly why Juliano could
kick that ball just by thinking,",HQzXqjT0w3k
386462,390781,"because he was wearing
the first brain-controlled robotic vest",HQzXqjT0w3k
390781,394060,"that can be used by paraplegic,
quadriplegic patients to move",HQzXqjT0w3k
394060,395871,and to regain feedback.,HQzXqjT0w3k
395871,398768,"That was the original idea, 15 years ago.",HQzXqjT0w3k
398768,404242,"What I'm going to show you is how
156 people from 25 countries",HQzXqjT0w3k
404242,407011,"all over the five continents
of this beautiful Earth,",HQzXqjT0w3k
407011,410029,"dropped their lives,
dropped their patents,",HQzXqjT0w3k
410029,414139,"dropped their dogs, wives,
kids, school, jobs,",HQzXqjT0w3k
414139,419656,"and congregated to come to Brazil
for 18 months to actually get this done.",HQzXqjT0w3k
419656,423531,"Because a couple years after Brazil
was awarded the World Cup,",HQzXqjT0w3k
423531,427183,"we heard that the Brazilian government
wanted to do something meaningful",HQzXqjT0w3k
427183,428881,in the opening ceremony,HQzXqjT0w3k
428881,432621,"in the country that reinvented
and perfected soccer",HQzXqjT0w3k
432621,434827,"until we met the Germans, of course.",HQzXqjT0w3k
434827,436220,(Laughter),HQzXqjT0w3k
436220,438055,"But that's a different talk,",HQzXqjT0w3k
438055,442095,"and a different neuroscientist
needs to talk about that.",HQzXqjT0w3k
442095,444169,"But what Brazil wanted to do
is to showcase",HQzXqjT0w3k
444169,445894,"a completely different country,",HQzXqjT0w3k
445894,448782,"a country that values science
and technology,",HQzXqjT0w3k
448782,452665,"and can give a gift to millions,
25 million people around the world",HQzXqjT0w3k
452665,455500,"that cannot move any longer
because of a spinal cord injury.",HQzXqjT0w3k
455500,459104,"Well, we went to the Brazilian government
and to FIFA and proposed,",HQzXqjT0w3k
459104,462472,"well, let's have the kickoff
of the 2014 World Cup",HQzXqjT0w3k
462472,464844,be given by a Brazilian paraplegic,HQzXqjT0w3k
464844,469734,"using a brain-controlled exoskeleton
that allows him to kick the ball",HQzXqjT0w3k
469734,472010,and to feel the contact of the ball.,HQzXqjT0w3k
472010,474624,"They looked at us,
thought that we were completely nuts,",HQzXqjT0w3k
474624,477480,"and said, Okay, let's try.""""",HQzXqjT0w3k
477480,481720,"We had 18 months to do everything
from zero, from scratch.",HQzXqjT0w3k
481720,484956,"We had no exoskeleton, we had no patients,",HQzXqjT0w3k
484956,486173,we had nothing done.,HQzXqjT0w3k
486173,488509,These people came all together,HQzXqjT0w3k
488509,492757,"and in 18 months, we got eight patients
in a routine of training",HQzXqjT0w3k
492757,496855,"and basically built from nothing this guy,",HQzXqjT0w3k
496855,500435,that we call Bra-Santos Dumont 1.,HQzXqjT0w3k
501315,504740,"The first brain-controlled
exoskeleton to be built",HQzXqjT0w3k
504740,508896,"was named after the most famous
Brazilian scientist ever,",HQzXqjT0w3k
508896,510869,"Alberto Santos Dumont,",HQzXqjT0w3k
510869,516672,"who, on October 19, 1901,
created and flew himself",HQzXqjT0w3k
516672,523899,"the first controlled airship on air
in Paris for a million people to see.",HQzXqjT0w3k
523899,525918,"Sorry, my American friends,",HQzXqjT0w3k
525918,527228,"I live in North Carolina,",HQzXqjT0w3k
527228,532110,"but it was two years
before the Wright Brothers flew",HQzXqjT0w3k
532110,534274,on the coast of North Carolina.,HQzXqjT0w3k
534274,536849,(Applause),HQzXqjT0w3k
537339,542117,"Flight control is Brazilian.
(Laughter)",HQzXqjT0w3k
542117,545117,So we went together with these guys,HQzXqjT0w3k
545117,548018,"and we basically put
this exoskeleton together,",HQzXqjT0w3k
548018,551990,"15 degrees of freedom,
hydraulic machine",HQzXqjT0w3k
551990,554707,that can be commanded by brain signals,HQzXqjT0w3k
554707,558925,"recorded by a non-invasive technology
called electroencephalography",HQzXqjT0w3k
558925,562114,"that can basically allow the patient
to imagine the movements",HQzXqjT0w3k
562114,566065,"and send his commands
to the controls, the motors,",HQzXqjT0w3k
566065,567867,and get it done.,HQzXqjT0w3k
567867,570730,"This exoskeleton was covered
with an artificial skin",HQzXqjT0w3k
570730,574814,"invented by Gordon Cheng,
one of my greatest friends, in Munich,",HQzXqjT0w3k
574814,579400,"to allow sensation from the joints moving
and the foot touching the ground",HQzXqjT0w3k
579400,583940,"to be delivered back to the patient
through a vest, a shirt.",HQzXqjT0w3k
583940,586910,"It is a smart shirt
with micro-vibrating elements",HQzXqjT0w3k
586910,591733,"that basically delivers the feedback
and fools the patient's brain",HQzXqjT0w3k
591733,595204,"by creating a sensation that it is not
a machine that is carrying him,",HQzXqjT0w3k
595204,598454,but it is he who is walking again.,HQzXqjT0w3k
598454,601313,"So we got this going,
and what you'll see here",HQzXqjT0w3k
601313,606003,"is the first time one of our patients,
Bruno, actually walked.",HQzXqjT0w3k
606003,608881,"And he takes a few seconds
because we are setting everything,",HQzXqjT0w3k
608881,612178,"and you are going to see a blue light
cutting in front of the helmet",HQzXqjT0w3k
612178,616098,"because Bruno is going to imagine
the movement that needs to be performed,",HQzXqjT0w3k
616098,619306,"the computer is going to analyze it,
Bruno is going to certify it,",HQzXqjT0w3k
619306,621115,"and when it is certified,",HQzXqjT0w3k
621115,624642,"the device starts moving
under the command of Bruno's brain.",HQzXqjT0w3k
624642,629217,"And he just got it right,
and now he starts walking.",HQzXqjT0w3k
629217,632003,"After nine years without
being able to move,",HQzXqjT0w3k
632003,634673,he is walking by himself.,HQzXqjT0w3k
634673,636275,And more than that --,HQzXqjT0w3k
636275,639503,(Applause) --,HQzXqjT0w3k
639503,641290,"more than just walking,",HQzXqjT0w3k
641290,643608,"he is feeling the ground,",HQzXqjT0w3k
643608,645651,"and if the speed of the exo goes up,",HQzXqjT0w3k
645651,650102,"he tells us that he is walking again
on the sand of Santos,",HQzXqjT0w3k
650102,654293,"the beach resort where he used to go
before he had the accident.",HQzXqjT0w3k
654293,657757,"That's why the brain is creating
a new sensation in Bruno's head.",HQzXqjT0w3k
657757,661456,"So he walks, and at the end of the walk --
I am running out of time already --",HQzXqjT0w3k
661456,664180,"he says, You know, guys,""",HQzXqjT0w3k
664180,666811,"I need to borrow this thing from you
when I get married,",HQzXqjT0w3k
666811,669316,because I wanted to walk to the priest,HQzXqjT0w3k
669316,673090,"and see my bride and actually
be there by myself.",HQzXqjT0w3k
673090,676482,"Of course, he will have it
whenever he wants.",HQzXqjT0w3k
676482,680564,"And this is what we wanted to show
during the World Cup, and couldn't,",HQzXqjT0w3k
680564,684738,"because for some mysterious reason,
FIFA cut its broadcast in half.",HQzXqjT0w3k
685618,693291,"What you are going to see very quickly
is Juliano Pinto in the exo doing the kick",HQzXqjT0w3k
693291,695588,a few minutes before we went to the pitch,HQzXqjT0w3k
695588,698499,"and did the real thing
in front of the entire crowd,",HQzXqjT0w3k
698499,701880,"and the lights you are going to see
just describe the operation.",HQzXqjT0w3k
701880,706768,"Basically, the blue lights pulsating
indicate that the exo is ready to go.",HQzXqjT0w3k
706768,709843,"It can receive thoughts
and it can deliver feedback,",HQzXqjT0w3k
709843,712861,"and when Juliano
makes the decision to kick the ball,",HQzXqjT0w3k
712861,715964,"you are going to see
two streams of green and yellow light",HQzXqjT0w3k
715964,718641,"coming from the helmet
and going to the legs,",HQzXqjT0w3k
718641,722742,"representing the mental commands
that were taken by the exo",HQzXqjT0w3k
722742,724641,to actually make that happen.,HQzXqjT0w3k
724641,727336,"And in basically 13 seconds,",HQzXqjT0w3k
